WEBVTT

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.177
Son of a bitch.

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.286
Wait a minute.

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:38.375
You see it?

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.334
<i>Really? Where?</i>

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:41.596
<i>I don't, can't see anything.</i>

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.381
- There.
- <i>Ah, shit.</i>

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.818
I thought you fixed it.

00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:48.342
<i>I thought I had.</i>

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:51.736
Yeah, well, that's
why we test it.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.608
It is much better.

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:57.002
Look at the place.
You trashed the joint.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:58.569
<i>Yeah, they've been riding us</i>

00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:00.092
<i>on environment interaction.</i>

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.660
Huh. Pretty good
if you ask me.

00:03:02.834 --> 00:03:04.314
<i>Thanks. It isn't
easy.</i>

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:06.055
<i>Glitchy shit.</i>

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.407
<i>This is gonna take a while.</i>

00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:11.974
<i>I'll find a fix and let you know</i>

00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:13.323
<i>when we're good to test again.</i>

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:16.805
<i>Thanks, Hana.</i>
Anytime.

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.894
<i>And don't forget
to send us your invoice.</i>

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.468
<i>I'll make sure it
gets paid on time.</i>

00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:25.553
<i>Hey, Hana?</i>
Yeah?

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.076
<i>You entering this year?</i>

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.600
<i>Maybe show those
squeakers who's boss?</i>

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:31.167
<i>Heard the prize
pool's gone up too.</i>

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:34.083
The tournament? And
have my ass kicked again?

00:03:34.257 --> 00:03:37.565
Yeah, wouldn't miss
it for the world.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:38.566
Well actually guys, if
you would pay me more,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.698
I wouldn't have to.

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:42.134
<i>Well, you came close last time.</i>

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.703
Yeah, thanks, Alex. We'll see.

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:46.877
Ciao, ciao.

00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:04.467
Who is it?

00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.641
<i>Delivery.</i>

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:06.991
The delivery instruction says-

00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:09.211
- <i>Yeah, I know-</i>
- Says-

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:10.952
<i>There's no one
home up there, are there?</i>

00:07:11.126 --> 00:07:13.345
<i>This is your address, right?
And I need a signature.</i>

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.957
I don't want, I
don't, I don't want it.

00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:19.613
<i>Are you
kidding? It's from CNEX.</i>

00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:22.006
<i>I mean, I'll keep
it if you want.</i>

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.834
- Wait-
- <i>Look lady-</i>

00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:25.575
Just, uh... <i>I got other
shit to deliver.</i>

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:26.489
<i>I can't just hang
around here all day.</i>

00:07:26.663 --> 00:07:28.099
Just leave it there.

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:29.753
Leave it all and go.

00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:32.277
Stand in the stairwell
or something.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.932
<i>What? Uh, no,
I'm not gonna do that.</i>

00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:36.891
Please.

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:40.808
I'll be quick and, and
you'll get your signature.

00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:42.636
<i>Shit.</i>

00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:46.727
<i>Whatever.</i>

00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:49.337
<i>Okay.</i>

00:07:50.992 --> 00:07:52.254
<i>Okay. I'm going.</i>

00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:53.255
Thank you.

00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:54.429
Thank you. Thank you.

00:08:30.292 --> 00:08:31.554
You can do this.

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.396
<i>Come on lady.
I haven't got all day.</i>

00:09:03.978 --> 00:09:07.721
<i>When can I run the test?</i>

00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:15.729
Why are you scared?

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.385
I'm, I'm not.

00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:24.607
Can you let me in?

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:30.743
I can't.

00:09:33.355 --> 00:09:34.356
<i>Are we done here or what?</i>

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.530
No. Wait.

00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:05.692
<i>Hey, uh, I
thought those weren't out yet.</i>

00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:12.655
<i>Suit yourself. Have fun.</i>

00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:15.483
I will.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.365
I got it.

00:10:27.539 --> 00:10:31.456
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
I'll wait for you.

00:10:33.894 --> 00:10:38.725
Okay. Bye.

00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:01.328
Coming.

00:12:15.909 --> 00:12:16.909
Okay!

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.311
Jen?

00:12:39.628 --> 00:12:40.934
Ah! It is I!

00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:43.458
The outside world
come to get you.

00:12:43.632 --> 00:12:46.461
Whooo.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:48.724
You took your time, gee.

00:12:48.898 --> 00:12:50.813
Some of us have real jobs.

00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:53.860
But I brought food.

00:12:54.034 --> 00:12:56.384
You know, shopping.
Should try it sometime.

00:12:56.558 --> 00:12:58.908
Is that?

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.608
- Mm-hmm.
- Sweet!

00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.306
You haven't...?

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.438
- Mm-mm.
- Oh, it's so cool.

00:13:09.658 --> 00:13:12.269
Had to wait for you.
Wouldn't be the same otherwise.

00:13:16.839 --> 00:13:17.884
Shall we?

00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:19.058
Let's.

00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:22.757
Okay.

00:13:22.845 --> 00:13:24.238
Ooh, wait, shouldn't we,

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:26.196
shouldn't we do
an unboxing video?

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.111
You gotta think of
the hits, you know?

00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:32.333
Uh-uh. Full embargo until
the official lunch date.

00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:33.943
But that's months away.

00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:36.946
I know, but it's all mine.

00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:40.775
Okay.

00:13:45.085 --> 00:13:46.085
Here we go.

00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:54.790
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:57.706
- So what does it do?
- No idea.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.665
Man, there nothing
else. Not even stickers.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.406
No instructions.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.580
Hmm.

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.902
So we've got to log in.

00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:29.433
- Oh.
- Great.

00:14:34.264 --> 00:14:36.310
Why you, anyway?

00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:38.660
They want some pro gamers
to test it before the launch.

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:42.011
Push it to limits, check for
bugs, that sort of thing.

00:14:42.185 --> 00:14:44.231
Yeah, but not the top gamers.

00:14:44.405 --> 00:14:45.841
'Cause a bad review
from one of them

00:14:46.015 --> 00:14:47.756
and it'll be dead upon arrival.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.627
Whereas the has-been like you...

00:14:49.801 --> 00:14:51.586
Whatever, dude.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.590
I got one so it gives me an
edge over the others, I'm in.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:58.680
Whatever it does.

00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:01.813
<i>Hello, Hana.</i>

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:05.295
Oh.

00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:08.559
Uh, hi?

00:15:08.733 --> 00:15:11.214
<i>Please place
the device on your head.</i>

00:15:11.388 --> 00:15:12.563
<i>The power button</i>

00:15:12.737 --> 00:15:15.044
<i>faces the rear.</i>
What?

00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:17.655
- Um, sure.
- <i>Please place the device</i>

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:19.309
<i>on your head.</i>

00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:21.007
<i>The power button faces the rear.</i>

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:25.228
<i>Welcome to the CNEX Omnia.</i>

00:15:25.402 --> 00:15:29.145
<i>Calibration has begun.</i>

00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:34.585
<i>The Omnia is, in part, an
electroencephalography device.</i>

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:35.999
<i>Using neuroimaging it will learn</i>

00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:37.675
<i>to read, measure,</i>

00:15:37.849 --> 00:15:40.591
<i>and decode characteristic
patterns of your brain.</i>

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.593
Huh?

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:44.334
<i>The image you see on screen</i>

00:15:44.508 --> 00:15:47.468
<i>is a real-time recording
of your brain activity.</i>

00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:48.817
Shit. It's reading your mind.

00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:51.080
Shh. I'm trying to listen.

00:15:51.254 --> 00:15:52.814
<i>The Omnia is a
brain-computer interface</i>.

00:15:52.908 --> 00:15:55.128
Yeah, there we go.

00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:57.043
<i>Capable of controlling
every device, game,</i>

00:15:57.217 --> 00:15:59.175
<i>and program you use.</i>
What?

00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:01.134
- <i>In time-</i>
- Did you hear that?

00:16:01.395 --> 00:16:01.743
<i>It will have read your mind</i>-

00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:03.658
Hear what?

00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:05.399
<i>Before you're
even aware of the thought.</i>

00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:08.228
<i>Your reaction time will
effectively reduce to zero.</i>

00:16:08.402 --> 00:16:09.707
I can hear it,

00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.274
it's in my head.
<i>This program</i>

00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:11.796
- No way!
- <i>Includes exercises-</i>

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.711
- Yeah!
- No.

00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:14.669
<i>That will help
the calibration process.</i>

00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:15.670
<i>We recommend completing</i>

00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:17.411
- It's back?
- Yeah.

00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:18.673
<i>The full exercise program</i>

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:20.240
<i>before attempting
to use the Omnia</i>

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:23.156
<i>in conjunction with
other programs.</i>

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.681
<i>Once calibrated, the device
will work for you and you alone.</i>

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:28.770
Hey, I don't care.

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:30.641
I need a go.
No way. No.

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:40.347
Oh, typing. Cool.

00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:42.586
So I made you enough to keep
you going for a few days.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.091
Thanks, babe.

00:16:45.265 --> 00:16:46.701
How long you gotta
keep that up for?

00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:49.921
Typing? No idea.

00:16:50.096 --> 00:16:51.793
I looked up

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.969
what an
electro-sepha-thingma-jiggy is.

00:16:54.143 --> 00:16:55.362
Electroencephalography.

00:16:55.536 --> 00:16:57.799
Yeah, that thing-amy
on your head.

00:16:57.973 --> 00:16:59.583
They use it to diagnose epilepsy

00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.977
and monitor coma
patients and stuff.

00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:04.327
Oh yeah. Like it
said, brain activity.

00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.895
So it'll be an uphill
battle with you then.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.159
I mean, you could
be here for days.

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:17.557
Amazing.

00:17:19.081 --> 00:17:20.822
CNEX does it again.

00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:25.740
So what's it doing? Checking
that you know the alphabet.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.873
Do you know the alphabet?

00:17:33.617 --> 00:17:36.533
Hey, if that thing does
speed up your reaction time,

00:17:36.707 --> 00:17:38.579
imagine what it would
do for someone younger

00:17:38.753 --> 00:17:41.712
and, you know, let's
face it, cooler than you.

00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:43.758
Maybe you should give it to me.

00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.070
- Uh...
- What?

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:55.509
Oh wow. Congratulations, Hana.

00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:57.574
You've moved on to B, I'm
so very pleased for you.

00:17:57.598 --> 00:18:00.122
- No, I'm just-
- Should really eat something.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.218
Whoa. Did you see that?

00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:11.351
- What?
- I'm typing.

00:18:13.048 --> 00:18:15.790
- Bravo. So amazing.
- Okay, shut up

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:17.834
and watch this.

00:18:23.014 --> 00:18:25.016
Wait, how did you do...?

00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:31.153
Come on, admit
it. It's so cool.

00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:32.676
I mean, this is fucking amazing.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.330
Okay, okay. You got me.

00:18:46.864 --> 00:18:49.606
I guess I'll put this
in the fridge, shall I?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.569
"No, Jen. It looks
delicious, Jen.

00:18:55.743 --> 00:18:58.833
Let's sit down and eat
like civilized people.

00:18:59.007 --> 00:19:01.575
What would I do
without you, Jen?"

00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:04.404
Probably starve to death.

00:19:06.101 --> 00:19:08.103
I'll get it.

00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:09.385
<i>Hana, you're,
you're behind on your rent.</i>

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:13.413
Go away. No one's home.

00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:14.718
<i>Jen. Where's
Hana?</i>

00:19:14.892 --> 00:19:16.329
I know she's In there.

00:19:16.503 --> 00:19:18.026
- She's busy.
- <i>Doing what?</i>

00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:23.684
Okay, look, she'll have your
money, you geriatric asshole.

00:19:23.858 --> 00:19:26.774
<i>Just pay some, please.</i>

00:19:31.866 --> 00:19:34.912
Hana, I've got
tomorrow off as well.

00:19:35.086 --> 00:19:38.960
Let me know if something
interesting happens.

00:19:40.266 --> 00:19:41.615
I'll come down.

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:43.704
Do you wanna lock up behind me?

00:19:43.878 --> 00:19:45.445
Oh. Yeah, sure.

00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.547
Shit. The building.

00:20:01.722 --> 00:20:02.722
Okay.

00:20:18.042 --> 00:20:20.567
<i>During calibration, we recommend</i>

00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:22.917
<i>wearing the device at all times.</i>

00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:30.838
One, two, three.

00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:31.491
<i>The more you wear the Omnia,</i>

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:33.362
<i>the faster it will learn</i>

00:20:33.536 --> 00:20:35.451
<i>and better understand
your instructions.</i>

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:42.371
Four, five, six.

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:44.145
<i>Each calibration
exercise in this program</i>

00:20:44.199 --> 00:20:47.246
<i>is unique and designed
to stimulate specific</i>

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.726
<i>cognitive, corporeal, -</i>
Seven, eight

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.206
<i>- And subliminal-</i>
- Nine.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.339
<i>- Parts of your mind.</i>
- Ten.

00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:10.704
<i>Your neural reaction
time is slowing, Hana.</i>

00:21:10.878 --> 00:21:13.359
<i>The CNEX Omnia recommends rest</i>

00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:15.274
<i>before continuing
with calibration.</i>

00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:18.101
Jen?

00:21:22.237 --> 00:21:24.370
Yes, of course. Quitter.

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:36.295
Yeah. Bed time.

00:23:09.213 --> 00:23:11.172
<i>It's
me. Are you there?</i>

00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:17.744
<i>Why can't you play with me?</i>

00:23:17.918 --> 00:23:20.094
What about other kids?

00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:22.618
<i>There's no
other kids in the building.</i>

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.143
When I was your age,

00:23:26.317 --> 00:23:28.319
my mom wouldn't let me
play outside either.

00:23:28.494 --> 00:23:29.582
<i>Why not?</i>

00:23:31.235 --> 00:23:32.541
She was afraid

00:23:34.108 --> 00:23:37.111
something might happen to me.

00:23:37.285 --> 00:23:38.460
<i>What did you do?</i>

00:23:40.157 --> 00:23:41.637
I got good at playing on my own.

00:23:43.073 --> 00:23:45.641
- <i>Games?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:47.077
<i>What kind of game?</i>

00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:49.863
"Tetris" mostly.

00:23:50.037 --> 00:23:54.084
Played it for hours,
days, game after game.

00:23:55.521 --> 00:23:56.652
Even in my sleep.

00:23:58.915 --> 00:24:02.876
Endlessly falling
faster and faster till,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.445
until you start again.

00:24:08.272 --> 00:24:09.535
A new game every time.

00:24:13.277 --> 00:24:17.368
It's the only dream I have
that's no different to reality.

00:24:17.543 --> 00:24:19.503
Exactly the same as sleep
as it is when I'm awake.

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:28.945
I still dream of "Tetris,"
you know. I love that game.

00:24:30.947 --> 00:24:33.733
Do you know what "Tetris" is?

00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:35.822
I can lend it to
you if you like.

00:24:39.565 --> 00:24:40.609
Are you there?

00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:13.249
Hm.

00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:23.738
Hm.

00:25:36.143 --> 00:25:37.143
Hi, Dad.

00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:07.321
You do know I have a life
outside this apartment, right?

00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:11.804
I said call me if something
interesting happens.

00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:13.216
Playing catch is not
interesting, you know?

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.937
It's never been interesting.

00:27:15.111 --> 00:27:17.548
The exercise is interesting.

00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:21.509
It's about hand and eye
coordination, reflexes,

00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:24.381
depth perception, anticipation.

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:27.123
It's complicated
stuff. Amazing, huh?

00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:29.952
Suppose so, but
it's not much fun.

00:27:30.126 --> 00:27:33.129
I mean, you invite me,
into your bedroom no less,

00:27:33.303 --> 00:27:34.130
to play with your balls

00:27:34.304 --> 00:27:35.784
and this is what I get.

00:27:35.958 --> 00:27:38.700
Hey! Watch the face.

00:27:41.616 --> 00:27:43.662
Oh, poor, poor Jen.

00:27:44.837 --> 00:27:46.490
Would some music help, you know,

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.231
to get you in the mood?

00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:50.581
Not your music.

00:27:50.756 --> 00:27:53.236
Okay, fair enough. Yours then.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.891
Let's see what's in
your playlist, shall we?

00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:00.983
Nice!

00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:02.898
How did you...?

00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:05.074
I think a little more volume.

00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:09.688
Babe, you do have
good taste of music.

00:28:10.906 --> 00:28:11.906
Damn right, I do.

00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.061
- Do it.
- Are you freaking nuts?

00:28:35.235 --> 00:28:38.064
You said you wanna do
something interesting.

00:28:38.238 --> 00:28:40.806
Come on. I need your help.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.373
Shit, Hana, I'll get your
food, I'll get your mail,

00:28:43.547 --> 00:28:45.288
I'll even take out your trash.

00:28:45.462 --> 00:28:46.986
But this, can't
you just skip it?

00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:55.951
Are you being a chicken?

00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:57.474
Are you afraid of
a little blood?

00:28:57.648 --> 00:28:59.955
Jesus, Hana.

00:29:00.129 --> 00:29:01.367
Come on. Just
enough to draw blood.

00:29:01.391 --> 00:29:02.653
No, I'm out.

00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:06.005
Jen, please. I need this.

00:29:09.051 --> 00:29:12.272
I'm sorry, Hana,
but this is crazy.

00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:13.966
Okay? You're on your
own with this one.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.284
<i>Congratulations, Hana.</i>

00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:11.810
<i>You have completed
the exercise program.</i>

00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:13.681
That was it?

00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:15.335
<i>Calibration is complete.</i>

00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:17.337
<i>The Omnia will continue</i>

00:30:17.511 --> 00:30:20.644
<i>to learn from and
work with your mind.</i>

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:24.605
<i>Soon it will become
second nature to you.</i>

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:26.999
<i>You may even forget it's there.</i>

00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:31.351
<i>But remember, the Omnia
is with you always.</i>

00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.962
<i>Round one.</i>

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:03.834
<i>Cybernetics ready.</i>

00:32:37.259 --> 00:32:38.259
Ha!

00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:49.070
<i>Hana!</i>

00:33:52.682 --> 00:33:54.206
<i>Are you there at all?</i>

00:33:57.513 --> 00:33:59.341
Look, I'm working on it.

00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:02.605
It's just, you
wouldn't understand it.

00:34:04.346 --> 00:34:06.131
You'll have it soon.

00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:07.349
<i>You said that days ago.</i>

00:34:07.523 --> 00:34:10.004
Well, Jen said...

00:34:10.178 --> 00:34:13.007
That was just one
day ago, wasn't it?

00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:14.617
<i>Hana.</i>

00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:17.794
You'll have it next
week. You'll have it.

00:34:17.968 --> 00:34:19.057
<i>Next week, Hana.</i>

00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:21.407
<i>Next week or you're out.</i>

00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:25.802
Oh, by the way, which apartment
does that girl live in?

00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:30.503
She, she looks like
five, maybe six.

00:34:30.677 --> 00:34:32.331
I wanna lend her something.

00:37:50.964 --> 00:37:55.142
Hey Jen, would you, would
you mind coming over?

00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:02.367
No, no, it's fine.
Morning is fine.

00:38:04.586 --> 00:38:07.546
Hey, I'm sorry for,

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.289
I'm sorry.

00:38:15.902 --> 00:38:18.513
Thanks. See you in the morning.

00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:02.327
You don't think
you're taking this

00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:03.836
too seriously, do you?

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.621
Nah, I ran a diagnostic.
It can run faster.

00:40:06.795 --> 00:40:08.754
It's just-
Faster?

00:40:08.928 --> 00:40:12.322
So this tournament is my
chance to make some real money.

00:40:12.497 --> 00:40:18.328
The prize money for
this one is 250 grand.

00:40:18.503 --> 00:40:20.809
Yeah, but what's the rush?

00:40:20.983 --> 00:40:22.898
There'll be others,
right? More money even.

00:40:23.072 --> 00:40:24.770
Yeah, but once
the testing is done,

00:40:24.944 --> 00:40:27.990
and CNEX launches the Omnia,

00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:30.036
every button-masher out
there will have one.

00:40:31.516 --> 00:40:32.517
Screwdriver, please.

00:40:33.866 --> 00:40:35.345
- Huh?
- There.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520
Oh.

00:40:40.046 --> 00:40:41.787
I'll take that.

00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:47.532
So I must earn all I can
while, well, while I can.

00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:48.726
And I have it all to myself, so.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.317
Isn't that kind of cheating?

00:40:50.491 --> 00:40:51.729
I've checked the
conditions of entry

00:40:51.753 --> 00:40:53.102
and there's nothing out there

00:40:53.276 --> 00:40:54.974
that says anything
about using it.

00:40:55.148 --> 00:40:56.541
Well why would it?

00:40:56.715 --> 00:40:58.934
The Omnia hasn't
even been released.

00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:00.108
Exactly.

00:41:04.157 --> 00:41:08.378
That should do it.

00:41:09.554 --> 00:41:12.208
Faster, faster, faster.

00:41:12.382 --> 00:41:15.211
Okay. The tournament
starts in six hours.

00:41:15.385 --> 00:41:16.385
Exciting.

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:23.045
You know what else is
totally legit and above board?

00:41:23.219 --> 00:41:26.571
Placing a little bet on someone
you might call a has-been.

00:41:26.745 --> 00:41:30.052
Someone who you might get
more than generous odds on.

00:41:30.226 --> 00:41:32.490
Maybe it's someone you
help out all the time.

00:41:32.664 --> 00:41:35.449
Someone who actually
wants to repay the favor.

00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:37.407
You're not suggesting that, moi?

00:41:37.582 --> 00:41:39.497
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Okay.

00:41:39.671 --> 00:41:43.283
And how much might one think
to place on such a has-been,

00:41:43.457 --> 00:41:45.198
should I know of one?

00:41:45.372 --> 00:41:49.071
How much you've got?

00:42:06.436 --> 00:42:07.655
Yes!

00:42:09.701 --> 00:42:10.876
Oh, come on, come on.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.573
Good, hey?
Good!

00:42:12.747 --> 00:42:13.879
There you go!

00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:17.099
Oh, that was easy.

00:42:19.145 --> 00:42:20.755
The fucking king!

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.933
Muah. Thank you.

00:42:28.154 --> 00:42:30.417
Fucker never had a chance.

00:42:43.996 --> 00:42:45.911
Oh! The tournament is on.

00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:49.784
Okay, so there is victim one.

00:42:56.965 --> 00:42:58.488
I think I'm gonna buy a car.

00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:00.012
You can't drive.

00:43:00.186 --> 00:43:02.014
Details. Details.

00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:03.711
And then I'm gonna
buy you a new sofa.

00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:06.366
Oh, that's sweet.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:08.107
It's not for you.

00:43:08.281 --> 00:43:09.717
Also some new shoes.

00:43:11.937 --> 00:43:13.591
What are you gonna do?

00:43:13.765 --> 00:43:18.639
Uh, I'm gonna pay the rent.

00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:20.685
Exotic.

00:43:20.859 --> 00:43:22.512
Hey, for the rest of the year.

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:25.646
Maybe even more.

00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:29.432
Oh, shit.

00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:33.393
Hey are using my wifi again?

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:35.569
No, Mom.

00:43:35.743 --> 00:43:38.050
Hmm. Because I just-

00:43:39.573 --> 00:43:42.054
What?

00:43:42.228 --> 00:43:44.186
Jesus, Hana. You gave
me a heart attack.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.381
What the hell?
Did you see that?

00:43:45.405 --> 00:43:46.405
See what?

00:43:47.973 --> 00:43:49.173
Did you see the fucking screen?

00:43:49.235 --> 00:43:51.193
No.

00:43:51.367 --> 00:43:52.997
W- wha-w-what, what
are you talking about?

00:43:53.021 --> 00:43:54.196
I didn't see anything.

00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:56.285
Hana?
Um.

00:43:56.459 --> 00:43:58.200
Hana, Hana, talk to me.

00:43:58.374 --> 00:44:04.076
Okay, um, I need a break
and you finish it, okay?

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.488
- Me? No, I-
- Just, just play the game.

00:44:05.512 --> 00:44:06.512
- I-
- Play the game!

00:44:07.296 --> 00:44:08.296
Hana.

00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:15.087
<i>Hana!</i>

00:44:17.002 --> 00:44:18.442
Of course I'm not
gonna freaking win.

00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:23.616
<i>Hana!</i>

00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:20.630
<i>Yeah, well so I didn't win.</i>

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.025
<i>It's okay.</i>

00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:28.116
<i>You still did enough to
qualify for the next round.</i>

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:31.337
<i>Might work in our favor.
Better odds and stuff.</i>

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.732
It's not my fault.

00:45:34.906 --> 00:45:37.256
You know, more of a "Mario
Kart" kind of gal.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.475
<i>Got a thing for plumbers.</i>

00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:41.739
<i>Still, think I
could kick your ass.</i>

00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:46.308
<i>Hana, are you okay?</i>

00:45:58.103 --> 00:46:01.584
<i>Hana? I'm here, you know.</i>

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.520
I talked to that girl.

00:46:24.694 --> 00:46:27.088
She said her mom
wouldn't play with her.

00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:29.221
Never seen any children
in this building.

00:46:29.395 --> 00:46:30.395
Exactly.

00:46:31.484 --> 00:46:33.355
You know, maybe her mom's...

00:46:33.529 --> 00:46:35.444
What? And she wants
you to play with her?

00:46:35.618 --> 00:46:37.011
Like, that's so much better.

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:45.300
What's this gotta do with
crashing outta the game?

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:47.805
I mean, one, you were
winning, by the way.

00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:49.371
Ow!

00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:50.590
A game.

00:47:02.036 --> 00:47:03.429
It's not my fault, you know?

00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.387
No?

00:47:08.303 --> 00:47:09.303
No.

00:47:10.566 --> 00:47:11.654
It's genetic mostly.

00:47:13.308 --> 00:47:14.353
And environmental factors.

00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:19.097
I've got my bases covered.

00:47:21.795 --> 00:47:23.686
Your dad was agoraphobic
too? You've never told me.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:24.710
No. No.

00:47:29.107 --> 00:47:30.107
It was my mom.

00:47:32.284 --> 00:47:33.981
Your mom never
left the apartment?

00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:39.508
No.

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:46.646
And after she,

00:47:48.474 --> 00:47:49.910
all I've had was the games.

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520
They helped me forget.

00:47:55.611 --> 00:47:57.091
And now?

00:47:57.265 --> 00:48:00.007
And now, look at me.

00:48:02.357 --> 00:48:05.143
I'm here just like her.

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:08.929
Unable to leave.

00:48:15.066 --> 00:48:16.763
You can, you know.

00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.418
I'd help you.

00:48:19.592 --> 00:48:21.550
If you want me to

00:48:21.724 --> 00:48:24.858
just open the door and walk out.

00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:26.381
I'd be with you every step.

00:48:30.081 --> 00:48:32.083
It's shit out there.

00:48:32.257 --> 00:48:33.649
The world sucks
and everyone in it,

00:48:33.823 --> 00:48:36.130
but there are good bits too.

00:48:39.525 --> 00:48:41.701
We all do it every day.

00:48:47.446 --> 00:48:48.621
Not everyone.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.731
Hana, are you okay?

00:50:38.905 --> 00:50:39.905
Mm. Mm.

00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:41.864
Have you even slept?

00:50:43.692 --> 00:50:46.130
Yeah. I think so.

00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:53.963
I can do it. Just one more
round and then the final.

00:50:54.138 --> 00:50:55.313
You sure?

00:51:04.539 --> 00:51:05.539
I'll watch from work.

00:51:06.976 --> 00:51:10.328
The game or your bank balance?

00:51:10.502 --> 00:51:12.069
My bank balance. Probably.

00:51:14.984 --> 00:51:16.508
- I gots to go.
- Mm.

00:51:23.863 --> 00:51:24.863
Shit.

00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:35.613
Sorry.

00:51:42.229 --> 00:51:43.535
You know you could.

00:51:45.014 --> 00:51:46.320
It's not fear, babe.

00:51:55.416 --> 00:51:56.416
Ciao.

00:51:58.898 --> 00:51:59.898
See you.

00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:20.006
Jen, is that you?

00:52:22.878 --> 00:52:24.184
This is not funny.

00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:31.756
Hello?

00:52:34.325 --> 00:52:35.325
<i>It's me.</i>

00:52:36.631 --> 00:52:38.851
- Hi.
- <i>What are you playing?</i>

00:52:39.025 --> 00:52:41.027
I thought you were...

00:52:41.201 --> 00:52:42.507
Just stay there, okay?

00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:45.031
I've got something
for you. It's a game.

00:52:46.424 --> 00:52:49.514
You can borrow it if you like,

00:52:49.688 --> 00:52:51.187
but you've got to
promise to give it back

00:52:51.211 --> 00:52:52.604
if you borrow it, okay?

00:53:14.626 --> 00:53:15.626
Hey?

00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:26.202
Hello?

00:53:34.907 --> 00:53:35.907
Hey!

00:53:37.866 --> 00:53:38.998
Hey, it's not a game.

00:53:40.304 --> 00:53:41.479
I just wanna lend you...

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:18.079
Hey?

00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:24.739
No! No, No!

00:56:28.123 --> 00:56:30.387
No, like I told the other guy,

00:56:30.561 --> 00:56:34.042
I just wanna know if other
testers they, you know,

00:56:34.216 --> 00:56:36.523
they said anything about
side effects or something?

00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:40.440
No, it's, it's working
great. It's amazing.

00:56:40.614 --> 00:56:41.614
It's just...

00:56:44.313 --> 00:56:46.446
Yes, I've ran the diagnostic
like three times now.

00:56:51.233 --> 00:56:52.321
I mean, are you sure?

00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:54.280
Is that, is it all you can...?

00:57:00.025 --> 00:57:01.635
No, um, no.

00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:05.465
I've got a, mm-hmm, mm,

00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:07.075
listen, I'm using it now.

00:57:07.249 --> 00:57:09.556
It's, it's fine. I'm sure.

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.428
No, no. I do not
wanna send it back.

00:57:11.602 --> 00:57:15.083
Um, I need, it, look, it's fine.

00:57:15.257 --> 00:57:17.651
I'm sure it's working just
fine and everything is...

00:57:19.174 --> 00:57:20.174
Yes.

00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:23.570
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure.

00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:26.834
Yeah, thank you. You too.

00:57:27.922 --> 00:57:29.228
Fucking asshole.

00:57:49.553 --> 00:57:51.293
<i>Victory!</i>

00:58:50.614 --> 00:58:51.615
Oh.

00:58:53.704 --> 00:58:55.619
How did you get in?

00:58:55.793 --> 00:58:57.098
We've always been here.

00:59:04.149 --> 00:59:05.759
Don't be scared.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:02.729
This is too easy.

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:17.831
Oh shit. Hana,
you're killing it.

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.749
Oh my God. You're
so freaking close.

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:27.058
You've got him. You've got him.

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:28.407
You've got him.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.845
Oh my God. Yes, Hana.

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.019
You've done it.

01:00:40.462 --> 01:00:45.337
Jen, Jen, Jen?

01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:55.869
Jen! Oh my god.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.393
Jen, I won.

01:00:58.567 --> 01:01:00.787
I, I won the whole
fucking tournament.

01:01:05.966 --> 01:01:06.966
Jen?

01:01:08.142 --> 01:01:09.361
Christ, you missed it.

01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:12.451
Where are you?

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:16.846
Jen?

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:28.423
Jen, come on. What are
you doing in there?

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:31.122
I won. We need to celebrate.

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:33.993
Jen?

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:36.780
I'm coming in

01:01:36.954 --> 01:01:38.607
and you better not be doing

01:01:38.782 --> 01:01:42.524
what I think you are... doing.

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:54.318
The fuck?

01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:47.589
Omnia, are you there?

01:02:49.504 --> 01:02:50.984
C- can you hear me?

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:53.986
<i>Hello, Hana.</i>

01:02:57.034 --> 01:02:59.340
Are you doing this?
Showing me that?

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:03.083
<i>The Omnia is a tool.</i>

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:06.739
<i>It will only do
what you ask of it.</i>

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:09.437
<i>It is all you, Hana.</i>

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:42.166
Yeah?
- H<i>ey, I received the payment.</i>

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.212
It's what I owe you, Right?

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:46.823
<i>Thanks, Hana.</i>

01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:51.218
Hey, um, have you seen Jen?

01:03:51.392 --> 01:03:52.611
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:56.658
She left her stuff here
last night and I'm...

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.835
<i>Well, if I
see her, I'll let her know.</i>

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.009
Cool.

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:07.773
Jesus, Jen. Where are you?

01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:03.236
I was supposed to
be sad, and I was,

01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:09.199
but I got more from my
mom than I'd ever before.

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:13.290
That was the happiest
year of my life.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.120
We were so close.

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.297
It was special.

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:27.086
We were alone together.

01:07:28.914 --> 01:07:29.914
And I liked it.

01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:34.267
I liked being together.

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:40.099
Even when we couldn't
leave anymore.

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:49.152
She fed me first, always
made sure I was okay.

01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:56.202
In the end, she, Mom didn't...

01:08:59.004 --> 01:09:01.398
Stickers

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:10.884
Jen.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.700
Shit.

01:09:47.226 --> 01:09:51.535
Jen, where are you?

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:07.463
Hana.

01:10:08.769 --> 01:10:09.769
Hana.

01:10:13.905 --> 01:10:16.908
Jen. God, where you been?

01:10:27.614 --> 01:10:28.702
You're so wet.

01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:38.756
I can help. Wait here.

01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:40.366
Wait here.

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.648
I'm calling.
What have you done?

01:10:41.672 --> 01:10:43.282
I'm calling it...

01:10:49.984 --> 01:10:50.984
Jen?

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:17.576
You are using it.

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:22.190
You are using it to
get into my head.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.065
You are doing this.
You are controlling me.

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:29.022
No, no.

01:11:30.764 --> 01:11:32.853
No more.

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:08.324
I have to get out of here.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:41.660
Okay.

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.754
You can do it.

01:12:50.104 --> 01:12:51.715
Jen is just upstairs.

01:12:53.107 --> 01:12:55.545
One flight and you'll be there.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.938
Apartment 808. She'll be home.

01:12:59.549 --> 01:13:00.811
She'll be home.

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:12.039
Just open the door, walk out.

01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:26.402
Jen?

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:13.890
How long have I been here?

01:18:45.024 --> 01:18:47.157
You can do it, you can do it

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.468
Get away.

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:56.993
Jen? Jen?

01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.403
What's...?

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.912
Hello, Hana.
Welcome to the Omnia.

01:21:17.655 --> 01:21:20.310
<i>It's the only dream I have
that's no different to reality.</i>

01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:25.054
<i>Exactly the same asleep
as it is when I'm awake.</i>

01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:28.796
<i>Game after game,</i>

01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:35.934
<i>endlessly falling faster
and faster till...</i>

01:21:55.954 --> 01:21:56.954
Mom.

01:21:59.392 --> 01:22:03.005
Please.

01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:05.137
You have to let me leave.

01:22:07.966 --> 01:22:11.143
Mom. Mommy, please.

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:20.457
Why did you kill Jen? Why?

01:22:29.248 --> 01:22:31.207
Mom, Mom!

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:36.647
Please, please don't
hurt anyone else.

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:41.652
<i>Police!</i>

01:22:41.826 --> 01:22:43.349
I'll stay with you.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.400
I promise.

01:22:55.927 --> 01:22:57.146
<i>Police!
Open the door.</i>

01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:05.545
I'll stay with you. Please.

01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:09.680
<i>Open the door, ma'am.</i>

01:23:46.108 --> 01:23:48.936
Have you seen Jennifer Lewis.

01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:51.243
Do you know where she is?

01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:00.687
Speak to us, ma'am.

01:24:07.303 --> 01:24:08.913
<i>All I had was the games.</i>

01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:12.089
<i>They helped me forget.</i>

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.267
<i>But now I'm here.</i>

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:20.272
<i>Just like her, unable to leave.</i>

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:40.679
<i>I'll check the other rooms.</i>

01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:48.126
It's her. At least
I think it is.

01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:53.175
<i>Let's take her in.</i>

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:56.569
<i>I'll secure the site.</i>

01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:09.408
No! No, no, no, no, no!

01:25:09.582 --> 01:25:11.062
What are you doing?!

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:14.196
No, you can't! Leave
me here!

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:16.372
No! Don't let them take me!
