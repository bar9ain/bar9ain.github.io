WEBVTT

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.990
I beg you, no!

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.310
Ken, wake up, it’s me!

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.250
Please, please!

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.770
I love you.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.580
Cut.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.910
How many times was that?

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.320
The 31st.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.100
Okay, listen.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.310
That’s not it.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.530
Don’t stop, we’re not finished.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.620
This is the last scene of the film.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.270
If this scene fails,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.670
the whole film fails.
Do you understand?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.750
Yes.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.250
Do it again,
but I want to see terror in your eyes.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.440
- That’s what I was trying to show.
- Yes.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.300
We see how you act.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.100
We see it.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.850
But we also see
how bad your acting is.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.860
I want sincerity.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.700
Not fake tears. I want real tears!

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.510
- But--
- There is no “but”!

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.370
You act like shit!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.660
It is normal for you,
since your life is shit!

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.190
You spend your days on your fucking laptop!

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.390
I need--

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.670
The movie needs that last fucking scene,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.820
and you’re stopping us from getting it,
because your acting stinks. You suck!

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.220
You’re a c--

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.970
What’s the matter, asshole?

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.790
You piss me off, it’s my movie!

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.140
You shut your mouth!

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.070
You’ve been pissing me off since the start.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.560
So shut the fuck up!

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.350
- Stop!
- Asshole!

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.970
Stop, that’s enough!

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.000
Everyone calm down.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.000
We take 15 minutes and calm down.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.210
I’m going to get some fresh air.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.020
How are you? Take care of her.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.970
How are you?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.580
He’s sick, that man.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.200
Getting into such a state.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.810
No, it’s me.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.270
I understand what he wants,
but I can’t do it.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.560
No, no, that man is crazy.
He gave me a real slap.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.600
I’ve got to do it.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.370
I’ll call my agent.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.420
It’s not going to be like this.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.810
When you bite me, really bite me.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.780
Try to hurt me for good.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.870
- Can I come to your house tonight?
- If you want.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.350
We’ll have a bath with soap.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.670
Hold.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.160
31 takes, it doesn’t matter.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.620
I’m sorry.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.870
No, Chinatsu, it’s not your fault.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.890
Higurashi is crazy. I don’t know
what’s wrong with him, he is so tense.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.830
Here.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.360
Do you realize
how hard we work with a real axe?

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.770
It’s super dangerous.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.090
Does the insurance allow this?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.410
Is he like that
on all the movies?

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.390
Now he’s acting big.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.860
He got into a lot of debt
to be able to make this film.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.720
I can feel that.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.200
It’s super charged.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.180
But all the time,
even when he’s not here,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.970
it feels like this place is charged.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.590
There is a weird atmosphere.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.380
What could it be?

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.270
No, nothing.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.120
Go ahead, tell us.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.580
This place really is charged.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.870
I don’t know
if it’s true or not.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.430
Maybe it’s invented on the Internet?

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.620
But there are rumors about this place.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.470
It may be an urban legend.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.350
What rumors?

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.750
It would seem that
here, during the war, on this ground,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.220
the Japanese Army made experiments.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.310
The Japanese Army?

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.730
Are you sure?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.550
Yes, the Japanese Army.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.060
Chinatsu, it’s unlikely,
but not impossible.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.870
But, then...
What kind of experiments did they do?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.160
Human experiences.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.410
To revive the dead.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.720
Undead then lived here.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.730
You mean...

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.160
Yes.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.060
They will be resurrected by the Blood Star.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.290
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.640
But Hosoda will tell you,
he knows the story better.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.080
I am going for a smoke.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.450
Sorry.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.160
I no longer want to smoke.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.950
Sorry, forgive me.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.060
And...

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.900
What were we talking about just before?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.620
I said Hosoda will tell you,
’cause he knows the story better.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.730
Ah, yeah, that’s it.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.600
Hosoda.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.580
I wonder where he is.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.630
Wow.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.470
That was weird,
that noise was really weird.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.650
Could it have been the wind?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.850
Yeah.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.340
A fairly strong wind, then.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.640
Yes-- No-- Sorry.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.730
Natsumi, do you have zobies?

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.150
“Zobies”?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.020
Yes, zobies. A passion.
Something that interests you, zobies.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.570
Ah, hobbies.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.330
Alright, sorry, I...

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.660
And do you have any?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.550
Yes, I do some Krav-Maga.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.140
Krav-Maga?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.560
Yeah.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.680
It’s a self-defense technique.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.620
Okay.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.100
- Is it good?
- Yes...

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.970
it’s fun.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.360
If you like martial arts.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.370
Have you practiced for a long time?

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.400
One year, yes.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.320
About a year.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.100
A year.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.350
It’s long.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.780
It is very long.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.040
Shall I show you?

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.900
Yeah, seriously.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.640
Okay... super, great.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.180
“Grave maga”.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.390
Yes.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.760
Then, for example...

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.020
- Put down your glass.
- Yes.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.300
Put your hand on my shoulder.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.550
Okay, like, “Hello, ma’am.”

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.390
Are you okay?

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.530
Yeah.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.810
I’ll show you another one.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.110
Try to hit me.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.270
Okay, but not a hard one?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.730
No, of course not.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.310
Okay, uh...

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.300
It’s great.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.270
- It’s just two points, it’s stupid.
- I want to smoke again.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.180
Damn it. I can’t breathe anymore.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.340
Hosoda? You scared me.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.840
What’s happening to you?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.740
Ah, you want to act?
We’ll find you a role.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.250
What’s that blood for?

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.940
It looks like real blood. What the hell?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.150
It’s filthy! Help!

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.380
Help me, please!

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.140
Please!

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.040
What is this thing?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.980
Natsumi, do you think it’s a real arm?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.780
I don’t know, Ken.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.030
Who could have done that?

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.220
If it’s a fake, it’s very well done.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.920
That’s gross.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.980
Hold on.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.770
Oh, no, no, no.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.040
I don’t believe it’s a fake.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.570
It’s not one of your props?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.240
No, it stinks, it’s a real one.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.390
There is a watch.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.440
Ken, it shows the right time.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.690
This watch looks familiar.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.140
It’s not possible.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.180
Yamakoshi?

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.280
He smells of death!

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.340
But he <i>is</i> dead!
He’s missing an arm.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.590
It’s Yamakoshi’s arm!

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.210
My god!!

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.360
Watch out, Chinatsu!
Watch out!

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.460
- No, Hosoda!
- Stop!

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.690
Hey, you...

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.890
No, no, no, no!

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.380
Watch out!

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.670
Come on, help me!

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.390
Come on.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.520
There you go.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.890
What’s going on here?

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.440
But, then, the rumor...

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.840
No, it’s impossible.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.060
It’s not possible.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.750
But where did Yamakoshi’s body go?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.910
Oh, my God.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.390
Where is he?

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.910
The arm.
Chinatsu, catch it!

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.930
Take it, Ken!

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.080
Is this what you want, zombie?

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.590
Come get the arm, come!

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.370
Come on!

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.140
What’s going on, huh?

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.180
What’s going on, Yamakoshi?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.840
Do you realize what you are?

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.880
You have no more identity,
no more will.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.230
Is that it,
Yamakoshi?

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.150
A victim of globalization?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.410
A rot of the system?

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.940
You’re post-apocalyptic shit.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.390
You no longer have any willpower.
What are you doing?

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.370
Do you do anything in life,

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.250
apart from
getting fucked by the system of capitalism?

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.200
You have no soul, bro.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.520
Arm! Arm! Arm!

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.090
Arm!

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.720
Arm!

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.720
Arm!

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.150
Is this what you want? Are you interested?

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.410
Go, fetch.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.580
Chinatsu!

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.390
Chinatsu!

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:38.950
- Ken.
- Chinatsu.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.110
How are you?

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:44.920
My love.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.500
I want to--

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.630
Ken.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.200
Me too, but it isn’t possible.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.430
No, turn around.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.460
Here it is.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.380
Now I have sincerity.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.640
- There, you--
- Higurashi, what are you doing?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.530
- Do you feel the emotion?
- You scare me.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.910
Yes, keep this fear, live with it.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.520
- Do you feel the emotion?
- Do you realize what’s happening?

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.060
But obviously.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.910
I’m the one who’s directing, you moron.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.620
You are sick.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.290
Stop this camera.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.490
“Stop this camera”?

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.330
Do you think I did everything
to stop the camera?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.850
You’re crazy.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.980
I set it in motion, now it all starts.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.900
We can’t go back!
Ignorant.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.480
You still haven’t...?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.180
Yes, I have.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.890
You triggered the curse?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.200
Yes.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.950
He’s sick, this man!

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.640
Don’t say that!

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.160
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.780
It was a year ago
when I was writing the scenario.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.620
I was just next door,
in the small village of Shiwandjuku.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.260
I often came here,
I didn’t know why.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.350
As if I was attracted by a force.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.510
And then... I discovered...

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.070
“thiiings”.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.790
Things none of you could even imagine.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.640
But, then...

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.320
the rumor was true?

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.560
Yes.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.350
The rumor was true

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.000
and I shed blood to raise the dead.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.790
- No...
- And now we’re going to put ourselves in place,

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.750
because here, I have sincerity,
I have the truth.

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.920
Now you are hot.
We will be able to shoot this last scene...

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:41.520
because you are scared
and you have seen death.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.230
- What are you doing?
- No, go on. I’m going out for 2 seconds.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.370
- No.
- I have to go.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.430
- You’re not going out.
- I have to, sorry.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.770
No, we need you.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.600
- Sorry for being sorry, I--
- No, no, no.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.560
There are monsters outside.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.480
And I have some inside.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.600
She’s right.
There are monsters outside, it’s dangerous.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.930
We need you,
shut your mouth and come.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.130
Please.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.440
I don’t give a fuck. We need to...

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.650
Don’t break my balls, I need to.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.850
- I need to go.
- Jonathan!

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.040
Shut up! It’s breaking my balls.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.340
I’ll go.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.850
I’ll get him.
And we don’t stop the camera!

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.500
Are you okay?

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.880
Yes, I’m fine.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.810
- And you?
- I’m okay.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.060
- And you?
- It’s okay.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.360
And you?

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.830
Yes, fine.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.240
How are you?

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.670
Yes, fine.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.370
And you?

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.670
Yes, fine.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.400
Cool.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.930
And you?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.130
Yes, fine.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.420
- I’ve already asked, right?
- Yes.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.000
That’s it, but...

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.670
Well...

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.100
at least everyone is fine,
it’s good enough.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.730
Yes it’s good.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.190
This is--

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.350
It’s very reassuring.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.530
Very reassuring.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:56.820
Yes.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.740
It’s very reassuring.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.030
And...

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.110
And tell me...

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.890
- Chinatsu...
- “Natsumi”.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.420
Natsumi,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.980
can you tell us more about this rumor, please?

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.150
What does it mean?
“They will be resurrected by the Blood Star”?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.580
I’m not sure I remember well.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.080
But I think it may be
a brotherhood...

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.020
from a dynasty whose last shogun, Shishima,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.620
would have created
the Brotherhood of the Blood Star,

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.900
populated by the living dead.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.500
They are supposed to
live in peace, but...

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.630
if we kill one of them, then...

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.460
they will infect us all.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.900
Looks like someone woke them up.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.180
But could he have done that?

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.030
It’s me, Higurashi.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.520
Open up!

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.900
- There are monsters out here.
- What do we do?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.680
- Hurry up.
- I don’t know.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.100
- Here we go, let’s go!
- I take the axe.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.280
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.210
- They’re outside, the door is closed, hurry!
- Okay.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.670
- Open it.
- The door is blocked!

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.660
Quick, it’s not a joke.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.390
Me neither, it’s not a joke.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.300
It’s spreading too fast.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.690
Akira has transformed.
He is coming.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.000
- Alright, let me do it.
- Open up, damn it!

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.670
You’re right, it’s blocked.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.230
It’s blocked!

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.200
The door is blocked.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.830
Action!

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.670
Go ahead, bite them, bite them!

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.300
It’s great, awesome!

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.380
It’s brilliant!

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:10.050
Great!

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.980
Go ahead, smash it!

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.470
Yes, it’s brilliant!

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.930
Yes, suck it up!
This is a masterpiece!

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.310
Say goodbye, shitbag.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.200
Oh, the replica.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.980
Zombie bastard.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.410
- Yes!
- Fuck you!

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.280
You stink of shit.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.500
Yes!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.270
Yes, that’s it, great!

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.300
That’s it, we got it!
Turn it around.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.440
Where is he, Ken? I must--

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.100
Quick, let’s go to the car.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.380
Zombie rot,
I’m going to cut your ass open.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.310
Come on.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.850
Come on, come on.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.570
The keys.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.570
The keys?

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.570
There are no keys!

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.470
Who has the ki-ki?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.470
We don’t say,
“Who has the ki-ki?”!

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.690
Who has the keys?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.690
Yamakoshi.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.000
Yamakoshi!

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.140
The keys are in the bag.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.840
Let’s get going.
Leave me alone, Ken!

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:23.240
Take the keys in his bag.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.080
That’s it, we’re there.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.630
It’s my movie, I do what the fuck I want,
damn it! I am a director.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.200
No, no, no.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.080
Help!

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.590
Help!

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.860
Sayonara only had one arm.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.670
Thanks. We can go again, Ken.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.780
Shitty capitalism consumer bastard!

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.900
Consumer society!

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.040
What?

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.660
- Open, Natsumi!
- It’s us!

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.030
Natsumi, it’s us!

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.350
Natsumi, we have the bag!

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.430
Come in.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.070
What a nightmare.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.160
Did they bite you?

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.730
I don’t know.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.750
No, I think it’s just a scratch.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.130
Ah, yes,
I have the keys.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.100
One second. You...

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.210
Do you believe,
or are you sure?

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.000
I believe.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.590
Wait, we’re not sure of anything.

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.610
Exactly.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.310
No, let’s calm down, okay?

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.630
I’m calm, very calm.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.620
Stop, stop!

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.060
Bitch!

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.720
No, no, no...

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.860
It’s great, it’s really good.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.800
Get out of my way.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.700
- Wait for me, bitch.
- Damn it.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.530
Natsumi...

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.520
Please.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.500
I can’t take it anymore.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.830
Please leave me alone.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.440
It’s just an axe in the face.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.870
Chinatsu!

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.610
You again?

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.800
Stop, it’s a real axe.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.890
Not the two points.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.300
Stop filming.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.510
Stop filming, damn it.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:15.910
Don’t.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.190
No!

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.810
Nooo!

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.140
Is that what you want?

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.660
It’s over, my love.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.260
Walk away.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.620
She was crazy,
but she was right.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.980
- I may become one of them.
- Don’t say that.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.840
I don’t want to hurt you, my love.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.260
I don’t want to, Ken.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:39.530
Chinatsu!

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.430
Chinatsu.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.050
Arm...

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.390
Ken...

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.670
An axe here? What a luck.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.210
Ken!

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.940
Ken!

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.220
Ken.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.350
Ken.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.340
Oh, no.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:10.790
It’s not true.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.450
No, no, no.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.210
Please.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:25.750
I love you.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.020
- So...
- Ken...

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.260
There it is.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.760
You are great.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.600
Please, Ken.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.180
I leave you two.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.700
- Ken, please.
- I love you.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.420
Wake up.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.950
I love you. I love you.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.450
Stop!

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:55.970
- I love you.
- Stop, I can’t, Ken.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.650
I love you.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.800
Please, Ken.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.230
I love you.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.600
Ken...

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.800
I love you.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.620
What the hell did you do?!

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.370
He was supposed to bite you!

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.410
But you didn’t understand anything!
You’re stupid!

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.450
Wait, wait, I beg you.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.490
Your end is better.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.830
Give me two seconds, two seconds.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.370
Action.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.000
My name is Higurashi Shisheiku Higurasai.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.040
This is the recording of my last words.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.940
I triggered a curse.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.390
And it got away from me.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:11.100
I will die.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.650
My only hope

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:16.040
is to be resurrected
by the Blood Star.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.600
It’s too long!

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:20.640
No...

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:48.070
Cut!

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.750
Cut!

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.180
Cut!

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:42.960
EARLIER

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:42.960
MONTH

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.960
ONE

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.670
Cut!

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.410
Let’s move on to the next shot.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.030
Okay, great.
Philippe, can we have fake tears?

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.260
Come on, let’s hurry.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.000
It’s done.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.980
Okay, start the engine.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.260
- It’s rolling.
- And action!

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.230
Wait, why am I already crying?

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.440
Don’t worry, cry, that’s all.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.020
Okay.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.290
Hello, Rémi. How are you?

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.460
- Hey, Mounir, how are you?
- Great.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.300
- It has been a long time.
- Yes. How’s work?

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.380
Good. Well, it’s a little thing.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.340
Can I talk to you afterwards?

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.330
- Yes, really.
- Great.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.210
- Who is it?
- I will explain to you.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.450
Okay, cut.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.190
- It was fine like that?
- Yes, it was great, let’s move on.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.880
What kind of movies do you make?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.460
I’ve done a lot of things.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.490
Infomercials, reconstructions,

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.270
corporate films,

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.730
a documentary on the French touch.
Lots of stuff.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.580
He’s done a lot of things,
but nothing noticeable.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.720
And for the Net.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:20.660
Stuff on the internet,
that sort of thing.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.480
And what’s your motto?

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.750
My motto.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.060
“Fast, cheap and average.”

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.720
He promises to be
fast, cheap and average.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.580
He is perfect.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.660
Mrs. Matsuda thinks you’re the right person.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.560
That’s right.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.560
That’s great.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.170
A zombie movie?

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.430
Yes, but rather clever.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.860
During the filming of a zombie movie,

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.580
the crew gets attacked
and they all become zombies.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.190
Panic, fights, chases, etc.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.790
A kind of survival.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.130
In Japan, it was a hit.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.850
Have you mentioned the conditions?

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:00.910
- Did you mention the conditions?
- I will.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:06.000
This is for a new platform,
created in Japan... “Z”.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.890
“Z” like...?
Like nothing, like “Z”.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.840
Specialized in the B-series.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.040
Hence “Z”.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.660
That’s it.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.420
And that movie is for the opening.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.960
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.670
- Are you okay?
- I’m not done, not done.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.150
- There are one or two trouble spots.
- And they are?

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.040
It must be
directly broadcasted.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.040
Straightforward live.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.990
Live, live, live.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.010
She is super enthusiastic.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.710
And then, it must be
a one sequence shot.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.240
A one sequence shot... sequence shot?

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.730
A one sequence shot.
You don’t turn off the camera.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.710
- Half an hour without cutting.
- Half an hour?

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.450
Yeah, it’s sensational, that’s for sure.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.140
It’s sensational.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.050
It’s completely stupid.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.370
Damn, I almost got fooled.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.250
Nonsense.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.400
You’re kidding.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:28.570
I’m so stupid.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.960
- Do you accept?
- Do you accept?

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.830
- You really don’t want to do it?
- No, I don’t feel it.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.800
For once, you are offered something else.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.280
It’s mostly because
everyone refused.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.740
Why are you saying that?

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.690
It sucks,
no one wants to screw up.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.580
Even so, it’s a Japanese company.
This might be your chance.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.560
My chance to pass for an idiot.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.260
Half an hour in one shot.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.100
It must be tuned like clockwork.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.810
You have to be a clock to accept that.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:08.180
Well, don’t do “Hmm” to me.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.290
Yes, Nadia,

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.420
I know what a one shot is.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:15.380
And I know what 30 minutes means.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.170
Hi, Dad.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.900
Hey, my darling.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.720
The ki-ki,
who moved the keys?

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.250
We don’t say “the ki-ki”.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.970
- I have them, I’m going.
- Have fun.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.140
- Yes, I’m having a lot of fun.
- Is it going well?

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.500
Yes, it’s great.
I’m working on a masterpiece.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.130
Between Scorsese and Coppola.
Kiss.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.050
Kiss, my darling.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.060
It’s not going well.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.900
It wouldn’t be bad
if you went to see her.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.880
Yes.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.840
Fake tears are for fake actresses.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.920
We’re better than that, right?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.580
You can do it by yourself.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.830
Is there something
that has made you very sad?

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.000
I do not know.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.380
Are your grandparents alive?

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.210
- Yes.
- Shit.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.120
Have you ever had
a cat or a dog?

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:09.650
Excuse me.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.920
We have already discussed it
with the team

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:15.590
and they agree on the fake tears.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:20.180
Okay, but I try to
make her cry by herself, without any aid.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.240
I completely understand.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.420
But the director has
already confirmed. So I...

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.480
Yes, but I’m saying something else.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.210
Don’t stay close to your child,
you’re ruining my work.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.930
And the way you speak to my daughter...

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.500
- I know what I’m doing, okay?
- I don’t think so.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.790
“I don’t think so”... Well, yes.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.290
What a bitch.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.230
I don’t care, it’s unbearable.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.670
- Can we find a solution?
- No, no, no.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.320
No, you understand, not here.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.310
Alright, you’re fired.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.240
I couldn’t do anything.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.420
Wait, Romy.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.840
All this for fake tears?

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.560
What the fuck do you care?

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.800
What the fuck do I care?

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:34.410
It is with emotion
that Gerard Nolleau...

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.750
That’s your thing!

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:34.410
returns to the scene
of the accident.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:42.500
RETURNS TO THE DRAMA AT THE CRANES

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:41.420
When facing his demons,
Gerard couldn’t contain his emotions.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:47.250
He had been heroic,
but the price to pay was too high.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.310
At the time of evaluation, Gerard...

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.980
You’re looking at crap.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.620
Can I change the channel?

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.000
Yes.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.960
Go ahead, my darling.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.290
Shit.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.110
More shit.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.420
Even more shit.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.800
It’s the evening of shit.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.210
It’s cool, it was a good day.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.470
I loved the way that...

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:10.470
Ah, cool.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.170
CONFIDENCES OF A RISING ACTOR

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.170
CANNES SPECIAL:

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.170
...she caught up with what I was doing.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.170
Who is it?

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.760
Raphaël Barelle, a great actor.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.330
You have a film selected at Cannes.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.680
It’s only a small role,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.460
CONFIDENCES OF A RISING ACTOR

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.460
CANNES SPECIAL:

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.460
but a day with Lars...

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.630
is worth 10 years of acting lessons.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.630
Excuse me.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.430
Lars is a platform of emotions.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.860
- Who is it?
- Raphaël Barelle. She adores him.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.330
He’s the trendy actor of the moment.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.930
Do you have new plans?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.910
CONFIDENCES OF A RISING ACTOR

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.750
Sure. I could talk about it?

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:45.340
Okay, let’s do it...

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:50.040
SCOOP: THE NEXT FILM BY R. BARELLE

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.040
Now I might do something bloody,
a zombie movie.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.480
Ah, a genre film?

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.950
- Yes.
- And who will do it?

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.060
That, I don’t know yet.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.750
It’s confidential.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.880
Is it a big role this time?

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.170
Yes, it’s the lead role.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.780
We can’t wait to see.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.000
I can imagine.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.040
You amaze me,
Raphaël Barelle as a zombie.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.680
He’s the next French Adam Driver.

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:16.880
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:23.490
Hello.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.690
I’m Mounir, the producer.

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.640
- Ah, hello.
- Nice to meet you.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:28.960
Me too.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.700
Are you okay,
not too nervous?

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:34.060
Not at all,
I’ve done a lot of shootings.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.700
- Great.
- And then look...

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.730
I did a story last night
with the scenario.

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.060
Look.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.560
134,000 views.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.360
- “Vjuse”?
- Views.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.020
Ah, “views”,
I’m so stupid.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.340
Yes.
I am very happy, Minour.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.970
- People are already waiting for it.
- Yes, but my name is “Mounir”.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.700
“I want sincerity.”

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.590
“You feel fear,
I want to see it on your face.”

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.180
“I want sincerity.”

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.820
“You feel fear,
I want to see it on your face.”

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.110
“I want sincerity. I want sincerity.”

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.360
“You feel fear,
I want to see it on your face.”

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.340
“No, we can see how you play.”

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:20.190
The zombie has a very strong
societal function.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.120
It is globalization,

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.460
consumerism,

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.790
globalization, capitalism,

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.410
it’s racism,

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.390
it’s the loss of will,
intolerance.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.320
Hello, I’m Armel.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.250
I play the assistant director.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:39.130
Are you Philippe?

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.000
We can be on a first name basis, right?

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.200
Okay, as you wish.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.060
- Yeah, let’s do like that.
- Okay.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.890
See you later.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.430
Are there any mint candy?

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.860
No, if there isn’t one here, it means no.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.660
That’s hard.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.680
Excuse me.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.270
- Is it hard water?
- Sorry?

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:08.960
Is that hard water?

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.360
I don’t know.

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.140
I have diarrhea, I don’t hide it.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.750
I only drink fresh water,
I had sent a message.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.560
Okay, I make a note.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.470
- Didn’t you read my message?
- I don’t think so.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.730
I sent it, though.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.210
- Verify.
- I’ll verify.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.890
“I want you to feel the fear.”

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:30.430
“I want to see it
on your face.”

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.060
“I don’t want you to act.”

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.270
“We see that you are acting.”

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.930
“I want you to feel real fear.”

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:39.660
“I want to see it on your face.”

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:42.370
“I want sincerity.”

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.290
“I want sincerity. I want sincerity.”

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.290
“I don’t want you to act.”

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:51.680
“I want you to feel fear.”

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.220
Sorry.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.830
Who are you playing?

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.520
Me? It’s rather what I play.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.600
I’m the musician, Fatih.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.820
Okay, Fatih, that’s your name.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.570
- Yeah, it’s not my job.
- Yeah, that’s for sure.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.850
- We can’t all be called Philippe.
- No, but I...

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.030
Please.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.180
I think we’re all here.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:22.390
We can start, if you don’t mind.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.930
I’m very happy to see you all.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:32.100
I am very happy for this
special, atypical, risky project.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.870
By the way, thank you, Ms. Matsuda,
for being here. Thanks.

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.390
Thanks a lot.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.960
No problem.
“Doitash”...

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.280
Here...

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.560
Well, it’s going to be great.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.350
I mean, it can be great.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.620
No, I’m sure it will be great.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.220
Hello.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:58.200
Sorry for the delay.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.580
The nanny left me,
my husband is not there.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.770
Sorry.

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:04.060
Shall I take care of her?

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.090
No, it’s not necessary.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.890
She won’t get in the way.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.410
She is super quiet.

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:11.640
“Exactly...

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.080
“we can see how bad you act.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:19.640
“I want to believe
that what you see on your face is true.”

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:23.160
“No, Mr. Director, you can’t!”

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.330
“I can.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.310
“It’s my movie!

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:28.980
“I know what’s good for my movie.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.430
“Stay out of it.”

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:31.730
“That’s enough.

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:34.160
“Let’s take a break
and calm down, all of us.”

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.720
Very good idea.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.850
Hush.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:38.700
He may be hungry, right?

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.310
Excuse me, Rémi,

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:45.270
is it possible
to avoid throwing up on myself?

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.850
Me... I’d like to try,
but my agent doesn’t want to.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.980
Don’t worry, it won’t be real vomit.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.810
I know, but it’s all about my followers.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.300
No problem, don’t worry.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.600
- It’s not even a topic.
- Thanks.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:01.960
You’re welcome.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.420
Rémi, can we talk a bit about the script?

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.460
Of course.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:11.290
With Lars, compared to the script,
we tried to bring things.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.990
Okay. And?

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.190
I’m not a fan of the axe.
Zombies have no will.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:21.310
So, if they are using an axe,
that’s nonsense to me.

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.500
Using an axe means they have a will,
but then they’re not a zombie.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.390
Oh, that’s interesting.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:30.180
Yes.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.680
The zombie is dehumanization,
that’s what terrifies the viewer.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.430
The axe has re-humanized them,
so they are less scary.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:41.020
They are less scary with the axe?

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:42.100
Yes.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.930
Ah, that’s interesting.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.470
Well, yeah.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.560
Excuse me, I listen without listening.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.170
You know,
there are many kinds of zombies.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:57.850
There are some
who go super fast, or who talk...

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.030
I’m not telling you to shut your mouth.
But I’m talking to the director here.

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.690
Wait...
I’ll think about it.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.770
I promise you, I’ll think about it.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.350
What do you think?

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.720
About what?

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.060
All right, then, be careful,
it is a Japanese script.

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.520
They know more than us
about zombies.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:20.250
But I will consider it.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.130
It’s interesting.
Promised.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:26.770
Hey, he’s hungry, huh?

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.520
He is hungry.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.450
It’s impressive.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.850
It’s super, the rehearsals.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:39.970
It’s my first time, it’s great.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:43.270
What’s the matter?

00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:45.600
I find it a little disgusting.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.960
Why?

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.810
Giving the nipple in front of everyone.

00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:51.390
It’s beautiful.

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.260
It’s nature, it’s not disgusting.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.710
- Not disgusting?
- No.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.540
If I took my ball out
and had it sucked by an infant...

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.040
wouldn’t it shock you?

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.940
It has nothing to do with that.

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.920
It’s got a little bit to do with it, buddy.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.060
Nobody works here?

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.270
Apparently they’re taking a break.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.750
Jerk-offs.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:24.130
BEFORE

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.130
WEEKS

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:24.130
THREE

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.670
We’ll start up there.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.540
- You take the camera and the axe.
- Okay.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.310
Here, Fredo?

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.700
There are none of my props.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.920
There is still my monologue.

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:44.250
- Is this the latest version?
- Look at the title.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.250
The new version is great, well done.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.270
Thanks.

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.480
It just have to be validated
by the Japanese company.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.980
Do they have to validate it?

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.430
History of...

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:57.470
What works over there
doesn’t necessarily work here.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:00.220
There’s some very Japanese-Japan stuff.

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:01.640
What?

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:05.770
What you said is super racist.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.440
Nonsense, we’re not Japanese.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.650
There are things
we don’t understand the same way.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.500
There is Chinese-China,
Polish-Poland humor.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.130
- Or Tunisian-Tunisia.
- Or Spanish-Spain, I got it.

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:22.210
- So?
- Don’t say that to Ms. Matsuda.

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:23.600
Yes?

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.210
“Racist”, that’s nonsense.

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.140
Right, we leave like this.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:32.060
We turn around.

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:33.860
Raphaël, get in place.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.020
There, we stay like that.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.600
We go around.

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.060
There, we see the team.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.060
Go ahead, Jonathan, the pole.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:44.060
And here, we put ourselves behind.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.600
Like this.

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.430
Okay.

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:47.890
You kept the axe.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:49.600
Um, yes.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.710
It’s stupid.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:52.580
We’re missing something here.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.390
The image of zombies, you see?

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.180
That’s a shame-- Stop, please.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.790
Are you stupid or what?

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.880
He’s a moron.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.680
Hold on, calm down.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.830
Yes, but we were
talking here.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.830
Give up the...

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.960
Sorry, but we’re missing the image of zombies.
I told you about it.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.600
I say...

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.390
Damn.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.930
It sucks.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.550
- Mounir?
- Yes?

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.560
Is there a problem if I use fake tears?

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.850
No worries.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.600
Go ahead, it’s cinema.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.810
Thanks.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:28.060
You’re welcome.

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.080
We don’t give a fuck about that.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.330
Rémi, it’s going to be fine.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:39.660
Tears, not tears,
we don’t give a fuck.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.480
Okay, good.

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.390
But where are they?

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.270
- I’m here.
- Not you, the actors.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.560
Oh, they are...

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.250
Alright, let’s take a break.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:57.060
I thought of something lethal.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.430
Oh, yeah?

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.000
We are going to add gratin sounds.

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.670
- Gratin?
- Squeaky stuff

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.500
to give a creepy side, you know?

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.600
- Ah, squeaks.
- Yes, squeaks.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.240
Because you said “gratin”.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:17.120
Things that scratch,
then squeak, you see?

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.780
- You see, what a gratin is--
- Forget the gratin.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.640
I’m talking about squeaks.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.990
It’s gonna be deadly.
It’s gonna be creepy.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.640
It’ll be great.

00:54:32.350 --> 00:54:33.600
Great.

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:36.310
Is that Dad’s script?

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.370
What is it about?

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.140
A director triggers a zombie curse
to be able to film...

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:47.580
with real zombies,
and everyone becomes zombies.

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:48.810
Seriously?

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:50.770
- Is it good?
- Yes, it’s funny.

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.770
It can be good.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.250
However, you have to love zombies.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.980
Don’t you feel like it?

00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.200
Like what?

00:54:58.550 --> 00:54:59.630
To play in it.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.090
Oh, no.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.040
You don’t want to be
an actress again?

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.660
Instead of getting excited
for Krav-Maga.

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.350
I’m not excited, it’s just a hobby.

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.720
You need an average hobby.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.490
Word Scramble, Sudoku, yes.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.440
But Krav-Maga...

00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.580
I no longer want to be an actress at all.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:25.220
It’s really not for me.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.770
You were really good.

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.770
By the way...

00:55:34.810 --> 00:55:37.130
Do you know
who plays in Dad’s movie?

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.550
Hey.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.510
- Everything’s fine?
- Yeah, fine.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:59.970
BEFORE

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.970
WEEKS

00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:59.970
TWO

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:03.470
Ah, is it you, Frank?

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:06.560
What’s happening to you?
You want to act?

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.640
Is this blood?
Where will the blood be?

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.260
In the mouth. Go!

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.100
- In his mouth?
- Yes.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.410
- Ah, my arm.
- Here?

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:16.720
Ah, my arm.

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:19.140
You’re freaking out, okay.

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:20.810
The arm...

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:21.890
Here.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:24.140
Ouch, my back.

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.100
What’s the matter?

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.500
Two minutes for me. Sorry.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:29.730
No problem.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.680
Ah, lumbar spine of a bitch!

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.100
Ah motherfucker, shit!

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.790
Ah, his mother...

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.930
Oh, motherfucker.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.560
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:43.770
It concerns the drinking.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:46.130
- Don’t worry.
- Exactly...

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:47.730
Excuse me.

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:51.010
I’m not a fan of the replica.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.770
Antoine’s arm.

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:53.750
Why?

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:57.120
It is stupid, it looks like
the guy is doing a puzzle.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.270
There’s an arm on the ground, his buddy
has one arm missing. We got it, right?

00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:03.080
I pass for a fool.

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.300
Yes, I mean, your character...

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.840
My character is me.

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.500
Don’t play with words.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.500
It looks like Scooby-Doo.

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.790
- What would you say?
- Nothing.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:19.000
- It’s not my job to write.
- No, but in real life?

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.960
- Are you kidding me?
- Not at all.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.420
The real life?

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:24.290
- It’s a zombie movie!
- Yes.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.990
Nothing is coherent or realistic.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.480
If a director talks to me like that,
I ought to slap him.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.010
Raphaël,

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:33.890
you are super good.

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:37.530
What you give off is...

00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:40.210
solid, you see, massive.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.810
Honestly, don’t worry.

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:46.920
It’s American style, you show it,
that’s Adam Driver over there.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:50.250
I know, but I’m not talking about that.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.390
I’m talking to you about truthfulness.
Well, you understand nothing.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.840
And if we discovered the arm...

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.670
with a big zoom in?

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.020
It sucks, a zoom.

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.560
Yes, but if we do it well...

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.400
it might be super cool.

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.960
We are here
and the zombie arrives.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.490
Bam, we zoom in.

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:15.240
Vroom, zoom out again.

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:17.170
Whoo, we come back.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.020
You’re too close.

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.970
Sorry.

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:24.810
Are there any toilets on the site?

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:28.010
No, but we are going
to have Algeco installed.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:33.230
Okay. I’d like to know
where and when the info comes.

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:34.390
Understood.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.500
Because I had sent you an email.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.370
Okay, sorry, I didn’t see it.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.660
Didn’t you read it?

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.180
I don’t know, maybe we didn’t get it.

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:50.080
You don’t read the emails that I send you?

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.180
I am sorry.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.660
I sent the email.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.430
Yes.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.330
I sent the email.

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:07.530
I get it.
It’s my fault, I’m sorry.

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.060
I sent it to you.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:20.590
BEFORE

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:20.590
WEEK

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.590
ONE

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.550
Ms. Matsuda is waiting for
the return original authors.

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:30.620
But she thinks some things...

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:34.140
are incomprehensible
and some are dumb.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.530
Ah, dumb...

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.140
Yes, it’s interesting.

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:45.240
But rightly so...

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.420
The idea was to help us understand better.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.040
The French public is not
accustomed to this kind of films.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.470
They are not always
at the level of the Japanese.

00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:59.140
Like with the Hi-Fi, for example.

01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:06.800
Is your Hi-Fi the dumbest thing you’ve got?
You’re creating problems here.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.680
No, I’m trying to solve them.

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:11.990
So that we can better understand the story.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:14.770
We don’t care about the story.
We do what the Japanese want.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.880
We have to stop saying “the Japanese”.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:21.780
They did Pearl Harbor too, the Japanese.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.380
Don’t translate.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.960
Please.

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:37.290
Pearl Harbor...

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:50.410
Can you stop your thing, Fatih?

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.560
Excuse.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.470
Are you working?

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.600
Yes, yes.

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.790
Yes, well, I...

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:21.470
It’s not bad, your T-shirt.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.660
He pisses me off, Tarantino.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:48.110
There, you come back,
you want your arm.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.420
Arm!

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.600
There, that’s good.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.730
You, you’re scared and you...

01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:55.980
Bam!

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.310
Great. And there, the arm...

01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:00.250
will land on Ava.
Okay?

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:03.370
You, the director, you live,
you don’t stand still.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.350
Does that suit you?

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.020
I mean, would that make you feel better?

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:12.220
No, well, anyway, that’s not the problem.

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:13.520
Agree...

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.810
But how many times
can a zombie die?

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.880
I would say 9 times.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.210
That is cats.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:21.920
Why do you want
to know that?

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.630
Well, it’s not clear.

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.750
We kill them, they come back.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.970
We kill them again, they come back again.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:32.330
- Then, nothing more, we understand nothing.
- Okay, fine.

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.990
- And there is something that would suit you?
- Yeah.

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.040
That we had a real director.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.850
Wow, that exit.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:44.490
No, it’s normal, it’s getting closer.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.670
- We don’t all handle stress the same way.
- Rémi, the wig bothers me.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.260
No, that’s great.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.440
It is <i>Kill Bill</i> and <i>Pulp Fiction</i>
and we need it to...

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:56.130
- The axe.
- Let’s take a break, so...

01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:00.750
I’m going back to the cabin.

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.060
Okay, let’s take a break.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.020
Excuse me.
Don’t you think my role is a little small?

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.770
No, there are no small roles,
there are only small actors.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.080
There are also small roles.

01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:16.890
Is your back better?

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.890
I can do it, you know?

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.350
Forget it. 30 minutes with the camera
on the shoulder, it’s not a girl’s thing.

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:26.340
Because you can
make a point with your dick?

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.180
You know what I mean.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.430
No, I don’t.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.720
Not easy with Raphaël.

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:33.680
No one is easy.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.060
I know.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.020
Well, I have good news.

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:38.930
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:43.340
I take pills so I don’t drink
and I’ll be sober on set.

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.330
These are super strong pills,
you can’t drink when you take them.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.520
Okay.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.500
You can do it?

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.620
Yes.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.930
There’s my monologue and everything.

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.850
Then it ruins my life too much.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.400
You see?

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:06.380
- Yes?
- It’s my daughter.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:09.640
She is beautiful.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:12.560
She doesn’t want to see me anymore.

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.890
I ruined everything with her.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.980
I would have preferred to
be a good father, but...

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.210
That’s why I have to do it.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.460
But it’s hard.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.570
When I don’t drink, it’s too hard.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.290
It’s okay.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.420
Hold on, Philippe.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.770
Quiet.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.310
It is too hard.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:44.770
Philippe, don’t cry.

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:48.100
It’s okay, man.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.600
Are you okay?

01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.430
Yes, I’m fine.

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:06.180
Did the rehearsal go well?

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.680
Yes.

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:10.060
I mean, so-so.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:13.060
There’s no reason for it to go wrong.

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:17.430
And there is no reason
why it should go well.

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.490
BEFORE

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.490
DAY

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.490
ONE

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.180
Hello.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:27.140
Konichiwa.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.050
Ms. Matsuda spoke with the authors.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:38.890
They want you to stay faithful
to the original text.

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.560
I have remained faithful.

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:43.770
Even more faithful.

01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:46.790
We can’t even change the pronouns.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:48.860
Not even the pronouns?

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.290
But we’ll look like idiots.

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:55.140
“Like us at Pearl Harbor.”

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.840
Fatih, shut up.

01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:08.380
Sorry.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.140
BEFORE

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.140
HOUR

01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:14.140
ONE

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:24.770
Is it good?

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:26.560
We are going down.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.470
We plan it off-screen
and put it back in place.

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:31.430
Hello.

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.680
Hello, Nadia.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.810
Thanks for
your hospitality.

01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:34.810
With pleasure.

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:36.890
Hello.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.330
- Does she want to see her father work?
- Right.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:42.500
- Does she want to be a director?
- Yes.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:45.750
The apple don’t fall far from the tree.

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.530
- Rémi?
- Yes?

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.710
- What are these Japanese pronouns?
- So...

01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:56.540
You don’t, I hope.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.290
Damn, I can’t believe it.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.250
It’s just out of space.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.290
Laurent becomes “Akira”.

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:06.450
Muriel is “Natsumi”
and Anais becomes “Chinatsu”?

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:09.460
- It’s absurd.
- I agree.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.310
And I am “Ken”?

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:14.100
No wonder I’m Ken.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.080
Hey, on the other hand--
Don’t laugh.

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:18.080
No...

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.990
Don’t laugh, I’m the one on the screen!

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:22.380
Johanna wants to see you.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.010
Excuse me.

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:29.470
Wait, there is
a more serious problem than ours?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.660
Hello, everyone.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:33.920
Hello.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.700
Is something going on?

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:41.150
Gaby and Mélanie are at the hospital.
They had an accident on the road.

01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.890
Shit, what were they doing together?

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.470
Well, the actors...

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.000
- They have a history.
- But they are fine.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.350
We don’t care about that.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.210
We continue.

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.110
- We do without them.
- How?

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.960
Can’t we adapt the script?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.260
Not at all.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.560
It is the main roles
and starts in 45 min.

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:04.560
Let’s get replacements.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.540
We are two hours from Paris.

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:09.650
Should we recruit in the Yvelines?

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.680
They have to know the script.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.790
And be credible as
a director and make-up artist.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.350
Without a miracle,
you can’t find actors like that.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.480
Do you have
a better idea?

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.180
I know the script
and I am credible as a director.

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:28.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.520
Thank you, great.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:31.880
Okay it’s great, I like it.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:34.850
Me too, I really like it.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:38.640
There was a serious side to Carlos,
but that shirt... it’s not bad.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.130
Great, thanks Fatih.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:44.270
Without the make-up artist,
half of the problem remains intact.

01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:46.540
Yes, shit, the make-up artist.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:48.020
Here.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.000
She has been an actress
and has read the screenplay a hundred times.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.680
Wait. Sorry.
Excuse me.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.280
Hold on, one second.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.310
Why are you getting involved?

01:08:58.350 --> 01:08:59.310
Any better idea?

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.370
She is unable to control
herself while acting.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:08.180
At some point, she tips over
and believes that everything is true.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.430
You have no idea
how many problems we had.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.430
With the actors, the insurances.

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:15.390
I don’t want to repay for 6 years.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.770
It’s out of the question.

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:18.180
We may end up in deep shit.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.470
It’s out of the question.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.520
He’s right.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.140
It’s not what was planned.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.890
But one, we have no choice.

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:30.180
And two, Nadia is an actress.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:35.100
And not only is she an actress, but also...

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.790
She... she’s really an actress.

01:09:40.890 --> 01:09:42.020
In a nutshell...

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:45.060
Don’t worry, I’m used to...

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.810
I mean, I got this.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.700
Rémi, can I talk to you for a sec?

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:56.640
Well, we had our differences.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.810
It’s okay.

01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:59.850
But now, we agree, don’t we?

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:00.980
We have to stop.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:02.730
No, never mind.

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:05.180
We have an audience
waiting for us, we can’t.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.020
If we can, we must. But...

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:11.560
what we can’t do
is make fun of people.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.310
Trust me, don’t worry.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.790
It is not that <i>I</i> worry,
it’s that <i>you</i> worry me.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.670
Everything worries me.

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.120
I can hear you.

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.980
The Japanese pronouns,
then the actors are changed at the last minute

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.770
and the screenplay
isn’t worked out.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.270
We are going to make
the worst movie in the world.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.390
Listen, Raphaël.

01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:34.140
You’re at the top
of a big diving board...

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:35.680
at the edge of the void.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.730
You’re a little scared, it’s normal.

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:39.520
But if you do it...

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.980
your dive will be insane.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.940
And down there,
a hot bath is waiting for you.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:47.230
Or a swimming pool without a float.

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:51.430
Or a swimming pool without floats.
I’m not telling you it’s a done deal.

01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:53.260
I’m telling you it’s possible.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.270
If we all focus, we can do it.

01:10:56.310 --> 01:11:00.600
It’s like in the theater, at the moment T,
we will all sublimate ourselves.

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.580
- Did you do theater?
- No, but who cares.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.640
We all have to believe in it.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:10.950
And I need you to lead everyone.

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:15.180
And remember that we
are not immune to a miracle.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.830
Nor a big dung.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:20.970
There is always that risk.

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:23.060
Excuse me.

01:11:23.890 --> 01:11:29.880
Agent Greg
I looked at the contract.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.880
Agent Greg
There’s nothing we can do.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:29.880
Agent Greg
Sorry.

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.880
Agent Greg
You have to do it.

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:30.460
Good.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:32.150
We are going to bet
everything on the miracle.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.850
There you are.

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.930
Is that Jonathan’s canteen?

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:38.700
Yes, we forgot his water.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.270
Shit.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.930
He pisses us off with his “hard water”.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:45.600
Besides, the guy is obnoxious.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.980
I can’t blame him.

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.310
He’s an asshole.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.730
I don’t care if it makes him shit.

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:55.350
As the cast has changed,
there may be small errors.

01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:56.640
But we do not care.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.520
Errors, accidents...

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.890
Shit.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.460
- Sorry.
- Great, thank you.

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:08.230
So little mistakes, accidents,
we make use of them.

01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:10.680
Unless something serious, we continue.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.310
We don’t stop the camera.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.480
Stay focused on your part.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:18.850
So accept--
Hey, what’s that?

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.310
It’s sake.
It’s a gift from Mrs. Matsuda.

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:23.850
Well, now is not the time.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:26.350
We’ll talk about it later, okay?

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:29.600
So accept whatever happens.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.640
And rest assured,
nothing serious will happen.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.850
Okay?

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.540
So now is the time.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.730
So it’s up to you to play.

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.600
Well, it’s up to us.

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:45.440
So come on, let’s go! Damn everyone!!

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.770
Thank you, Fatih.

01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:58.660
BEFORE

01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:58.660
MINUTE

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:58.660
ONE

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.480
How are you?

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.060
Hmm, hm, okay.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:16.180
It is stage fright, it
always happens to me.

01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:17.980
Do you want some water?

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.250
No, I have mine, it’s fine.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.200
“No, please...”

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:35.640
“Aaah... No, no, no.”

01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:39.720
“I want sincerity.”

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:51.940
- Okay, shit. See you later.
- Thanks.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.520
Stand-by in 30 seconds.

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.020
“The 31st.”

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.430
“How many times was it?”
“The 31st time.”

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.160
“This place is really charged.”

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:01.680
“This place is really charged.”

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.390
“I don’t know if it’s a rumor or not.”

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.390
- “31st.”
- “I don’t know.”

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.270
“He has no more arms?”

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:12.270
“No, but he’s dead.”

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:14.890
“He no longer has an arm,
is it his arm?”

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.770
“It’s Yamakoshi’s arm.”

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:18.060
“We see how you act.”

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.020
“And in addition,
we can see how bad your acting is.”

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.040
“Me, I want sincerity.”

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.100
“Sincerity.”

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:29.660
“I beg you, no. No, aaah!”

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.240
“Aaah...”

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.230
“No no!”

01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:34.380
Stand-by in 10...

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.500
Wait, where is he, Philippe?

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.810
Philippe, damn it, Philippe!

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.370
I was in the bathroom.

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:46.020
Bathroom.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.680
He said “bathroom”?

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:53.220
Action.

01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:59.200
“I beg you, no!”

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.100
Please, please!

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:28.750
Cut.

01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:40.020
How many times was it?

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.520
The 31st time.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.180
Good...

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.810
Isn’t that Rémi Bouillon?

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.810
Yes, it’s the director.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.580
Isn’t that weird?

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.920
This is the last scene.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.030
I didn’t know he could act.

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:07.390
...the whole movie is a failure.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.140
I want to see terror in your eyes.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.850
I was trying to show that.

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:13.980
Yes.

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.270
We see that you are acting.

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:17.270
Hush!

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:20.060
And besides,
we can see how bad your acting is.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.830
I want sincerity.

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:23.130
I want real tears.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:26.750
You play like shit!

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:29.640
- All day on your cell phone.
- Damn, he delivers.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.600
There, he improvises.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.220
Oh?

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.550
We need that fucking last scene!

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.560
You are stopping us from getting it
because you suck!

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.140
You’re at c--

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.970
What’s wrong with you, asshole?

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.910
You piss me off!

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:47.390
It’s my movie, shut the fuck up!

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:50.270
You’ve been pissing me off
since the start!

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:52.790
So shut the fuck up!

01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:54.520
He strays from the script.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.770
But he’s good.

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.420
Everyone calm down.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:01.160
We take a 15 minutes break.

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:03.100
No thanks.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:10.410
I’ll get some fresh air.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:28.600
He’s right, but I can’t do it.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.930
How was it?

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:31.980
Great.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.060
You came out strong.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:37.310
I didn’t remember my lines,
so it came out as it came.

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:38.930
We saw that.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.470
- But how was it?
- Yes, yes. Super.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.570
- See you tonight.
- Yes, if you want.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:52.540
I tried a voice that was a bit...

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.560
31st time, it makes no sense.

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.550
Sorry.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.020
No, Chinatsu, it’s not your fault.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.510
Higurashi is totally insane.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.490
These pronouns
seems like a punishment.

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:08.630
No, it’s not that bad, don’t worry.

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.890
Is that how you’re going to play?
Great, it’s very believable. Cool.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.040
Here, during the war...

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.540
on this ground,

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.000
the Japanese army
would have made experiments.

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.630
The Japanese army?

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.720
It’s like the movie.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.510
I have a problem with Philippe.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.100
Severe?

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.060
It might be a huge problem, yes.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.540
He’s playing in a minute.

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:45.330
- Philippe?
- What’s happening?

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.670
Damn. Philippe, wake up.

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:49.970
Philippe!

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.610
He took a box with sake.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.920
No, no, no, no.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.080
Fuck off.

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:12.380
Go get the signs.
Hurry up!

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:16.600
Philippe.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.140
Come on.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.950
I’m fine.

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.950
Okay?

01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:26.850
No, no...

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:32.810
Wow, that noise was weird.

01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:34.100
Really very weird.

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:36.770
Fuck, fuck it.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.650
I-I messed up, huh?

01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:42.430
Come on, come.

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.550
Excuse me.

01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:46.020
Hurry up.

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:47.810
I screwed up.

01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:50.680
Hush.

01:19:52.890 --> 01:19:55.390
WE HAVE A SMALL PROBLEM. IMPROVISE

01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.580
Say, Natsumi, do you have zobies?

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:12.020
- “Zobies”?
- Yes, zobies.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.720
Passions, something that
interests you. Zobies.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.560
Do you know where we are?

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:19.380
Because right now, I’m a little lost.

01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:20.980
I’m in the dark.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:23.060
I do some Krav-Maga.

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:24.880
Where are we now?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.850
It is not clear.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.620
But what are they talking about?

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.310
That’s exactly
what’s not clear.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.790
Done it for a long time?

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.310
A year.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.440
Yes, about a year.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.600
A year.

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:46.810
That’s a long time.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.930
It’s a very long time.

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:55.060
Rémi, we can’t continue here.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.140
We are ready, send out Armel.

01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:00.930
That’s great.

01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:04.020
It’s just two points.
It’s all stupid.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.330
I want to smoke again.

01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:19.600
It’s you, Hosoda?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.100
You scared me.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.600
What happened to you?

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:24.430
Ah, do you want to act?

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:26.520
Don’t worry, we’ll find you a role.

01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:28.720
What is this? Blood?

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.600
But...

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.360
Ah, it’s disgusting.

01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:36.810
Help, help me!

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:39.600
It’s disgusting.

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:43.560
He puked me, damn it.

01:21:43.630 --> 01:21:47.610
- But it’s fake.
- No, it stinks like real vomit.

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:50.470
No it’s fake, but has a real stench.

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:54.270
Johanna,
come here.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.180
At the same time,
it’s really zombie-like.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.830
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, it is.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.470
Wait, Ken, the watch is on time.

01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:08.140
This watch looks familiar.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.140
Okay, it’s good.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.100
It’s great.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.890
Thanks, Philippe.

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:18.270
Very funny.

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:26.960
Damn...
You’re a pain in the ass.

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:28.770
I vomited a little.

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:30.060
Yes, we saw.

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:32.710
- It never happened to me before.
- Come on, hurry up.

01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:35.770
I had to eat, maybe it wasn’t fresh.

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:38.160
Or they put Antabuse in my drink.

01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:40.430
His arm is missing.

01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:42.120
It’s Yamakoshi’s arm.

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:44.060
My God!

01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.020
Watch out, Chinatsu!

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.350
Watch out.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:51.850
Stop!

01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:54.040
Don’t do it, stop!

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.700
Hosoda, wake up, oh!

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:09.310
It’s Mrs. Matsuda who suggested this scene.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:11.220
She finds this zombie very good.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.140
Okay, fine.

01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:15.650
What’s going on here?

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.470
I vomited again.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:33.280
I don’t know what I have--

01:23:31.810 --> 01:23:33.280
Shh, be quiet.

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:36.330
Sorry.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.330
I swear, shut the fuck up.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.850
He wants his arm.

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:46.810
Chinatsu, catch it.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.640
Take him away, Ken.

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.390
Is this what you want, zombie?

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.310
Come and get it, zombie.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.930
Come on!

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.100
What’s happening?

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.600
You’re stuck.

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.160
Get me out of this shit.

01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:05.680
I can’t, you’re stuck.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.060
Is this what you want?

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.020
Well, try to get it.

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.390
Wait, but where are they?

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.770
Don’t bother, there’s no camera.

01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:22.890
Shit.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.850
Where are they?

01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:26.640
It’s not possible.

01:24:27.310 --> 01:24:28.890
Fuck it.

01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:31.080
The cut off arm. What?

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.310
You stink, man.
I don’t know what you’ve done.

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.060
Rémi, we have a problem.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.020
Me too.

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.730
Hurry, you must go right now.

01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:43.500
What?

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.810
Shit.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:46.350
Where are you going?

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:47.270
I don’t feel well.

01:24:47.310 --> 01:24:48.520
Go back.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:53.100
What’s going on, Yamakoshi?

01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:55.930
Don’t you realize what you are?

01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:57.560
You no longer
have any identity.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.060
You no longer have a will.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:00.390
Is that it, Yamakoshi?

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:02.680
A victim of globalization?

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.430
A rot of the system.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.350
You’re post-apocalyptic shit.

01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:10.850
What are you doing?

01:25:10.890 --> 01:25:11.770
Keep busy.

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.520
What are you doing? You suck.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.890
Apart from being screwed
by the system of capitalism?

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.810
Thanks.

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:21.430
You have no soul.

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.890
Arm, arm, arm...!

01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:28.410
How are you?

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.100
I’m at a loss here.

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:35.870
I failed.

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:40.290
But it’s okay, I’m going to
catch up on my monologue.

01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:42.540
You do not understand.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.310
I discovered...

01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:45.730
thiiings.

01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:48.770
Things none of you could imagine.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.730
So the rumor was true?

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:52.890
Yes, the rumor was true and...

01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:56.440
I shed blood to raise the dead.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.270
And now, we are going
to put ourselves in place...

01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:02.630
because here I have sincerity,
I have the truth.

01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:05.870
- There I have the truth.
- It’s too long.

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:11.210
We will finally be able to shoot this
last scene... because you are afraid!

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.920
You have seen death!

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.210
- What are you doing?
- Go on, don’t worry about me.

01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.520
- No.
- I’m going out for 2 seconds.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.540
- No, no. You can’t.
- I have to, sorry.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.000
- That was planned?
- No, it’s improvisation.

01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:28.000
- There are monsters outside.
- And I have some inside.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.200
Damn, that sucks.

01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:31.250
- She’s right.
- It’s not...

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:32.930
It’s improvisation.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.970
Don’t break my balls.

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:37.020
I fucking want to.

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:38.520
I want to go.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.630
Jonathan!

01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:41.380
He called him “Jonathan”.

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.040
Did he say “Jonathan”?

01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:46.230
Where are you going?

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:48.210
Jonathan, it’s your turn.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.810
It’s your turn.

01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:52.040
I’ll do it on you.

01:26:57.970 --> 01:26:59.180
I’ll go.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.230
We continue.

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:02.520
We don’t stop the camera.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.480
Stop.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.620
Jonathan!

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:09.270
Are you stupid or what?

01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:10.680
I am sick.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.540
We need you.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.890
Ah, it stinks.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:17.560
Holy cow, it stinks.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.770
Jonathan, shit.

01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:20.770
I told you so.

01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:21.930
Piss off.

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.390
How are you?

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:25.140
Huh.

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.770
Yes, fine.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.640
And you?

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:30.970
I’m okay.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.880
And you?

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.360
- Yes.
They are in a loop.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.260
Yes, I see that.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.750
Really super boring.

01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:39.770
And you?

01:27:39.810 --> 01:27:41.270
Yes, I’m fine.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.090
Well, do we have the announcement?

01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:49.290
WE APOLOGIZE
FOR THE INTERRUPTION
DUE TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.420
Yes I’m okay. And you?

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.000
Yes, I’m fine.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.840
It’s shit, I’m not joking.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.980
Rémi, it’s Mounir.
Do you hear me?

01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:01.390
- Rémi, do you hear me?
- Yes, Mounir.

01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.120
We have a problem, do you have a plan B?

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.470
No, I’m in trouble.
It’s flowing like a stream.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.230
So, shall we stop?

01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.290
No, not now.

01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:13.700
Where are they?

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:13.700
Yes, I’m fine,
and you?

01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.740
They are doing well.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.230
In fact, they are nowhere.

01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:22.020
Either you come up
with a solution, or I will cut.

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:24.460
No, wait for 10 seconds.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.290
I’ll figure it out.

01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:28.920
We can’t do it anymore.
We are hitting a wall.

01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:30.910
I cut.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.470
Dad, I have a solution.

01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:35.010
Mom does Jonathan’s scene...

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:38.300
and he comes back
as a zombie for the fight.

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:41.930
A proper diarrhea

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:41.930
Yes, that is really great.

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.650
It’s great.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.600
You’re a funny family.

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:48.880
Send them a sign
and hang up page 17.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.370
Well, that’s reassuring.

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.470
Very reassuring.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.080
- Yes, it’s very reassuring.
- A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH JONATHAN

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.630
NADIA TELLS THE STORY OF THE RUMOR

01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:12.770
And...

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.160
Tell me,

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:16.640
- Chinatsu.
- “Natsumi”.

01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:18.040
Natsumi...

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.710
can you tell us a bit more about this rumor?
What does it mean...

01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:24.020
“They will be resurrected
by the Blood Star”?

01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:26.700
Here.

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.770
Excuse me.

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.560
I also saw things differently.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:38.000
It doesn’t matter.

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:40.720
Besides, there’s a hole in the story.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:45.180
“I discovered... ‘thiiings’.”

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:46.890
Nonsense.

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:48.970
No, you were fine.

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.220
You were very good.

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:54.810
How much longer?

01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:56.350
30 seconds.

01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:58.310
I’m going.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:04.560
Where is Jojo’s head?

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.430
Just over there, hurry up.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.810
Come on.

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:14.480
Come on.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.780
Hurry up.

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:23.540
It’s me, Higurashi! Open!

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.640
There are monsters out there! Open, quick!

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:30.500
Come on, fuck.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.980
But come here.

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:33.890
Hurry up, please!

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.060
There are monsters! Quick!

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:39.520
- The door is blocked!
- Move yourselves over here.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.390
Chinatsu it’s no joke!

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:44.100
Me neither, it’s not a joke!

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.890
Akira has transformed!

01:30:45.930 --> 01:30:47.460
Come on, it’s good.

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.520
He saw me, he rushes on me!

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:55.060
I triggered the thing,
it spreads too fast!

01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.640
Yes, it’s blocked.

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.220
I’m focused now.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.930
But you suck.

01:31:01.850 --> 01:31:03.220
Action!

01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:07.680
Go ahead, bite them, bite them!

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.650
It’s great.

01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:21.060
It’s great, a masterpiece!

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.740
Fuck it, yes.

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:24.140
It’s a masterpiece.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:25.890
Say goodbye, shitbag.

01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:27.770
The props, the head.

01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:29.620
Zombie crap.

01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.730
Fuck yourself!

01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:32.970
You fucking shit!

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.810
Was that in the script?

01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:35.930
Yes.

01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:39.800
Well, it’s not exactly the word,
but it’s the idea.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:41.910
Where is he, Ken?

01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:48.520
Quick, let’s go to the car.

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.890
Zombie rot.

01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:54.180
I’ll cut your asses open.

01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:13.310
Who has the ki?!

01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:15.730
- We don’t say,
- “Who has the ki-ki.” Who has the key?

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.030
Yamakoshi.

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.900
It’s good.

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:20.490
It’s still rolling.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.910
Let go of me, Ken.

01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:31.410
It’s my film, I do what I want.
I’m the director.

01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:32.540
Aih!

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.410
Sorry, sorry.

01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:41.620
No, no, no.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.200
This is a bit abstract, isn’t it?

01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:58.470
How do I do it? Bitch.

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.200
Quick, quick.

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:04.180
Come in, come in.

01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:07.890
Can you get up?

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:08.850
No, I can’t.

01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:12.140
Shit, can’t you shoot?

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.100
Sorry.

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.230
“Sorry”, but...

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:18.850
Rémi, I can film. Me.

01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:20.390
What do we do?

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:22.660
Let her do it.

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.710
Cool zooms by the cameraman.

01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:36.420
Have they changed
the cameraman?

01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:45.640
You hit me for real.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.430
- Yes, but--
- Even my father didn’t hit me.

01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:51.750
Come on, let’s go. I am sorry.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.520
- Nadia, stop. What are you doing?
- You’re not satisfied?

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.480
He told you to put yourself in place.
Move your ass.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.200
Poor bastard, acting bastard.

01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:03.630
- Nadia...
- You are sick.

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.520
- Are you okay?
- No, I’m not okay. We do shit.

01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:10.640
Oh, no, don’t fuck around, not now.

01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:13.390
- Nadia, no...
- We have to figure out something.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.430
But the producers are happy.

01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:17.730
No, this is shit.

01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:20.310
Nadia, please calm down.

01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:21.560
I’m calm.

01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:24.430
I am calm, very calm.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.670
Sayonara, “Has-only-one-arm”.

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:31.770
Thanks. We can go again, Ken.

01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:33.600
We’re on our way.

01:34:38.350 --> 01:34:41.220
Damn capitalism, consumer bastards!

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.850
Consumer society!

01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:51.680
Did they bite you?

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.930
She is super good, your mother.

01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:56.730
Yes, totally.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.560
It’s my first time seeing her perform.
It is very good.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.360
Why did she stop acting?

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.600
I think she got too caught up in the play.

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:06.990
Ah really?

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:11.250
One day she was filming with Van Damme,
and she broke his wrist.

01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:13.270
Van Damme, really?

01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:14.390
Calm down. Okay?

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.830
Alright, how’s it going?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.140
For me, it’s a bit of a mess.

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.560
It’s not what was planned.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.430
Fatih, it’s okay. We adapt.

01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:36.230
- Oh, shit.
- The high-kick.

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:38.200
A high kick right away.

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.500
It’s a stunt, it’s nothing.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.430
She’s acting.

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:47.180
The zombies have to block the kick.

01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.390
What’s going on here?

01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:53.180
I will be back.

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:04.020
Huh, wake up.

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.480
Hurry, it’s up to you.

01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.770
Go!

01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:11.720
What is the...?

01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:23.410
Great, that’s really good.

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.660
- Darling...
- Sorry.

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:27.630
- Fuck.
- Wait for me, bitch!

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.020
Shit...

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.890
Natsumi, please.

01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:34.060
She is crazy.

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.180
I know, I have to stop her.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.160
Is she often like that?

01:36:39.930 --> 01:36:41.540
It can happen.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.810
You must have had a hard time, poor guy.

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.390
Chinatsu!

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:51.930
You again?

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:53.330
Whore...

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.200
Ah, there you are.

01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:59.450
Stop, it’s a real axe!

01:37:00.930 --> 01:37:02.310
Not the two points!

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:05.680
Stop filming.

01:37:07.930 --> 01:37:09.520
Stop filming!

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:20.270
Stop it.

01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:31.410
Sorry, darling.

01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:47.130
That’s a long time, right?

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.040
Is this what you want?

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:17.180
They are back to the script, great.

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.120
I don’t want to, Ken.

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:24.770
Chinatsu!

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.680
Chinatsu.

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.440
Rémi...

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.790
They forgot the axe.
Shit.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.000
Put it down in front of the cabin.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.290
- But...
- Hurry up, quick.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.120
I’m going to pee.

01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:52.100
Ken...

01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:05.750
BE SCARED

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.140
YOU WILL FIND THE AXE
ON THE WAY OUT

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.830
YOU WILL FIND THE AXE
ON THE WAY OUT

01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:27.080
Here? An axe. What a luck.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.540
Without crane...

01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:31.810
- it’s fucked up.
- Change the camera angle.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:34.840
It must be 4 meters above the ground
if you want to see the blood star.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.580
Well, if you want to see it.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:38.380
I have to,
that’s the end of the film.

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.270
Otherwise, nobody will
understand anything.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:44.330
“The dead will rise from the Blood Star.”

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:45.610
Read the script.

01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:47.500
We can do without it.

01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:49.860
It’s the end image.

01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:52.310
People won’t notice.

01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:56.540
Yes, but... they know very well
when you serve them shit.

01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:00.200
We have to stop despising them,
the “people”, as you say.

01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:02.130
I’m sick
of this cynicism.

01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:04.510
This is not the time. We don’t care.

01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:07.480
Stop with your “We don’t care”!

01:40:07.570 --> 01:40:09.000
You suck!

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:12.050
Do you think you can solve
the problems by jerking off?

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:15.140
I’m talking to you about
what we’re doing, shit!

01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:16.960
Don’t tell me it’s not important!

01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:24.060
Oh, Ken.

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:34.280
Ken.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.220
Sorry Mounir, I got carried away.

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.060
It’s okay, Rémi.

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:49.020
It’s just a movie. Who cares?

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:52.270
“Fast, cheap and average”, right?

01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:57.060
You’re right.

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:02.080
The crane plan is deleted.

01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:07.330
We’ll step back
to film the star as best we can.

01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:10.200
Then end credits.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:11.640
Great.

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.980
I’ll come back.

01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:14.470
Hold on, dad.

01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:17.350
How many people are available?

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:28.060
No that’s not true.

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:39.220
Please.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.350
What’s that?

01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:49.210
It’s the crane.

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:49.210
The crane?

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:50.920
Shit...

01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:53.760
I love you!

01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.560
- Ken.
- There it is, it’s great.

01:41:59.270 --> 01:42:00.890
Did I miss a lot of stuff?

01:42:00.930 --> 01:42:02.810
Not as much as them.

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:05.350
I leave you.

01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:09.680
Hush, stop.

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.520
Ken, please...

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:13.680
wake up.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:21.560
Ken, stop.

01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:23.560
Wake up.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.720
I love you.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.600
Stop!

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.290
Ken, wake up, it’s me.

01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:43.250
Please, Ken!

01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:58.180
I love you.

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:12.240
What the fuck did you do?!
He was supposed to bite you!

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:15.440
You didn’t understand anything.
You are dumb.

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.220
No, wait.

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:23.530
My name is Higurashi Shisheiku Higurasai.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.080
This is the recording of my last words.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.090
It’s too long!

01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:46.020
Yes, that’s great. Go ahead.

01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:51.270
From anger.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.040
Yah!!!

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.380
Come on. That’s great.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.380
Cut!

01:44:04.770 --> 01:44:06.500
Cut!

01:44:06.970 --> 01:44:08.810
Cut!!!

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.020
Quick, quick.

01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:13.140
Go ahead.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.020
Dad, here.

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.020
Cut!!

01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:42.680
Come on, come on.

01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:14.470
Cut!

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:19.950
It’s finished.

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:23.020
We did it!

01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:25.430
It’s a crazy thing!

01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:31.640
- It was good, right?
- That’s right.

01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:34.980
It was not very expensive...
and they made it quick.

01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:37.640
- And it was average.
- That’s right.

01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:04.380
Ingenious, it was too good.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:06.640
But how did you think of that?

01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:45.000
I got a ladder,
but it was at the other end.

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.680
It’s finished?

01:51:46.710 --> 01:51:49.320
Oh, it’s over. Oh, shit.
