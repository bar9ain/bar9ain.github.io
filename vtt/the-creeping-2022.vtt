00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:45.532
- <i>Dad?</i>

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:46.498
- <i>Yes, Anna?</i>

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.034
- <i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>a scary story?</i>

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.209
- Once upon a time,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.181
there was a little girl
called... Anna.

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:08.588
And she lived in
a big house in the countryside.

00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:15.628
One dark and very creepy night,
she was asleep in bed.

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:19.498
All of a sudden, she woke up.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.202
From downstairs,
she heard a noise,

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:27.306
the floorboards creaking.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:33.145
Creak, creak, creak.

00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:35.815
And then a voice began talking.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:38.350
"Anna!

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:41.153
"Anna!

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.389
I'm coming to get you."

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.260
Then silence.

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:50.362
- What happened?

00:01:50.395 --> 00:01:55.300
- Beneath the blanket,
Anna heard breathing.

00:02:02.474 --> 00:02:04.844
She felt
the thing moving closer.

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:08.280
Long fingers on the blanket.

00:02:10.717 --> 00:02:14.286
And when Anna thought
she couldn't take anymore,

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:16.522
the voice said...

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:20.392
"I'm right here,

00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.663
"and I've...

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.765
got you!"

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:31.604
That was a good one.

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.540
- Okay you, time to sleep.

00:02:38.243 --> 00:02:42.682
Nana's going to bed too,
so no wandering around, okay?

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.717
Okay.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.491
- Lights on or off?

00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:53.893
- On.

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:56.228
- Sleep tight.

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:58.531
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.200
- Dad?

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:39.237
Dad?

00:03:45.044 --> 00:03:47.747
Daddy? Nana?

00:08:56.222 --> 00:08:58.924
Anna!

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:02.094
I thought I heard the door.
It's so lovely to see you.

00:09:02.128 --> 00:09:03.863
- Yeah and you.

00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:05.564
- That's one of you
nan's favorites.

00:09:05.598 --> 00:09:07.600
- Yeah mine, too.

00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:10.569
- So, so sorry to
hear about your dad.

00:09:10.603 --> 00:09:12.838
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
- I so enjoyed his visits.

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:14.173
Your nan loved him being here.

00:09:14.206 --> 00:09:16.709
Such a lovely, lovely guy.

00:09:16.742 --> 00:09:18.277
- Yeah, he really was.

00:09:19.378 --> 00:09:21.147
- How was the journey?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.082
- Yeah, lovely, fine, yeah.

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.984
- Oh, good.

00:09:25.184 --> 00:09:27.586
- Wow, this place never changes.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.021
- I know. I know.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.326
Well, she's so
excited to see you.

00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:37.930
Lucy.

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:42.868
Lucy darling,
look who I've got here.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.038
- Hey, Nan.

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:48.874
- Maggie?

00:09:48.908 --> 00:09:51.644
- No, it's-it's Anna,
sweetheart.

00:09:51.677 --> 00:09:54.780
It's Anna,
your gorgeous granddaughter.

00:09:55.848 --> 00:09:56.982
- Anna?

00:09:57.016 --> 00:09:59.118
- That's right, darling.

00:10:02.254 --> 00:10:03.789
I'll go put the kettle on

00:10:03.823 --> 00:10:05.591
and give you
a chance to catch up.

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:11.330
- Hi, Nan.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.912
- Is Maggie here, too?

00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:30.282
- No.

00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:32.618
Maggie's not here.

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:35.287
It's just me.

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:37.823
- That's a shame.

00:10:40.092 --> 00:10:42.628
- I'm here to look after you.

00:10:44.363 --> 00:10:46.165
- Hmm.

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.654
- Bet you need that
after your long drive.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.360
You must try not to
take it personally, Anna.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.928
- Hmm.

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.834
She doesn't even remember me.

00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:26.805
It's just that,
sometimes she's lost in the fog

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:28.374
and sometimes
she's finds her way out,

00:11:28.407 --> 00:11:31.043
but she's still the same
person you grew up loving.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.945
She's so happy you're here.

00:11:32.978 --> 00:11:34.246
- Hmm.

00:11:36.282 --> 00:11:37.750
Hmm.

00:11:41.987 --> 00:11:43.989
Strange being back.

00:11:45.357 --> 00:11:48.294
I have so many memories
tied to this house.

00:14:07.032 --> 00:14:08.535
Hmm.

00:14:35.427 --> 00:14:36.596
Hmm.

00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:38.897
- <i>Anna.</i>

00:14:39.965 --> 00:14:42.201
Ready or not
here I come.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.206
You can't hide forever.

00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:51.143
I'm coming to get you.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.613
I wonder where Anna is?

00:14:53.747 --> 00:14:55.381
Lets get another one.
- Okay.

00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:57.584
- Where could she be?

00:14:57.883 --> 00:15:01.453
I wonder if she's here!

00:15:08.093 --> 00:15:08.994
- You want to play another one?

00:15:09.027 --> 00:15:09.962
- Yes.

00:15:09.995 --> 00:15:12.131
- Ten. Nine.

00:15:12.164 --> 00:15:16.034
Eight. Seven. Six. Five...

00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:51.136
- It's really good you're here.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.739
You know, it's important
being around family,

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:55.174
it's going to
do your gran a lot of good.

00:15:55.207 --> 00:15:57.443
- Yeah, well, I hope so.

00:15:57.476 --> 00:16:01.980
- Um, and I'll be back
about ten in the morning

00:16:02.014 --> 00:16:03.415
- Yeah, great.
- if that's alright with you?

00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:06.151
- Alright darling,
everything will be okay.
- Alright.

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:08.120
- Night, darling.
- Bye. Night.

00:16:08.153 --> 00:16:10.122
- Get home safe.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

00:16:23.335 --> 00:16:25.638
- You look
just like your father.

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:27.540
Same eyes.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.742
You've got Harry's eyes.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.010
- Have I?

00:16:32.712 --> 00:16:34.547
- Where is Harry?

00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:37.049
Will he be staying here, too?

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:39.084
- No, Nan.

00:16:39.652 --> 00:16:41.521
He's not with us anymore.

00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:43.723
- Where did he go?

00:16:44.022 --> 00:16:45.658
- He's gone.

00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:49.161
Dad...

00:16:50.062 --> 00:16:52.097
Harry died, Nan.

00:16:54.233 --> 00:16:59.271
- Yes. No. Of course.

00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:02.575
I knew that, I knew that.

00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:06.278
Such a shame.

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:08.615
Lovely man.

00:17:10.315 --> 00:17:11.483
Hm.

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:17.657
He used to dance with me,
insisted on it.

00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:21.326
He knew how much
I enjoy dancing.

00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:23.228
Lovely man.

00:17:23.262 --> 00:17:25.364
- Hmm. He was.

00:17:25.698 --> 00:17:27.667
- I remember the wedding.

00:17:27.934 --> 00:17:29.769
Happiest day of Maggie's life.

00:17:29.802 --> 00:17:32.805
Oh, they loved
each other so much.

00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:36.208
- Do you remember
much about Maggie?

00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:38.277
- She loved your father,

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:40.547
loved him with all her heart.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.381
My Maggie.

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:44.817
How happy she was.

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:50.255
Harry danced with me
at the wedding.

00:17:51.858 --> 00:17:54.727
He was always
playing the same song.

00:17:54.928 --> 00:17:57.797
Erm, what was it?

00:17:57.897 --> 00:17:59.599
He played it all the time.

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:02.134
I can hear it now.

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:03.836
Ooh...

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:09.074
I can hear it now.
Erm, what was it called?

00:18:10.342 --> 00:18:13.145
Everyone knew
it was Harry's song.

00:18:13.378 --> 00:18:15.882
We danced to it together.
- Nan, it's alright.

00:18:15.915 --> 00:18:19.217
- What was it? What was it?
- Nan, it's okay. Nan. Nan. Nan.

00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:20.118
- What was it? What was it?
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:18:20.152 --> 00:18:22.522
Nan! I know the song,
I know the song.

00:18:22.555 --> 00:18:24.456
It's okay, I know the song.

00:18:50.282 --> 00:18:54.754
♪ <i>A love no one understands</i>

00:18:55.054 --> 00:18:59.659
♪ <i>You and me</i>

00:19:07.734 --> 00:19:09.802
- My Maggie.

00:19:10.503 --> 00:19:15.407
- It's Anna,
not Maggie, you remember.

00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:17.510
- Nonsense.

00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:24.517
- Maggie died a long time ago.

00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:27.787
- Go to sleep.
It's your bed time.

00:19:28.186 --> 00:19:30.255
We don't want to
wake up your father

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:32.692
otherwise he'll get angry.

00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:39.264
Give me a kiss then.

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:44.236
- Goodnight.

00:23:07.707 --> 00:23:09.041
Nan?

00:23:28.761 --> 00:23:30.395
Nana?

00:23:58.824 --> 00:24:00.425
Nan?

00:24:09.135 --> 00:24:10.636
Nan?

00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:24.750
Nan?

00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:28.888
Oh, Nan.

00:24:29.221 --> 00:24:31.157
Are you okay, Nan?

00:24:31.691 --> 00:24:35.094
Here, let me help you up.

00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:37.129
Here, hold on to me.

00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:40.232
Oh, Nan.

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:43.002
- Wh... Where are we?

00:24:43.035 --> 00:24:46.005
- We're in the kitchen, at home.

00:24:47.139 --> 00:24:48.808
What you doing?

00:24:49.408 --> 00:24:52.044
- I'm clearing up the mess.

00:24:53.112 --> 00:24:55.047
Do I know you?

00:24:56.682 --> 00:24:59.652
- I'm your granddaughter, Anna.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.488
- Oh, yes. Anna.

00:25:04.156 --> 00:25:06.559
She's my granddaughter.

00:25:07.927 --> 00:25:10.096
Such a clever girl.

00:25:11.664 --> 00:25:12.965
- Oh, Nan.

00:25:13.232 --> 00:25:15.568
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:17.069
Hold on to me.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.905
That's it, slowly.

00:25:24.143 --> 00:25:25.745
- <i>She's okay.</i>

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:28.714
Let her sleep a bit longer.

00:25:28.748 --> 00:25:30.082
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:25:32.752 --> 00:25:34.954
<i>She's the only</i>
<i>family I have, you know?</i>

00:25:35.888 --> 00:25:37.656
I just want to keep her safe.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.225
- Of course you do.

00:25:39.258 --> 00:25:40.726
That's what family's all about.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.896
Protecting each other.
Looking out for each other.

00:25:44.096 --> 00:25:46.198
I mean, in effect
you're the parent now.

00:25:46.232 --> 00:25:49.602
- Oh god, Karen.
Then we're in big trouble.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.595
Oh.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.165
Hey, buddy.

00:27:06.112 --> 00:27:08.914
- He won't talk to
anyone else but me.

00:27:08.948 --> 00:27:10.716
Very rude.

00:27:10.816 --> 00:27:13.352
I told him,
I said, "That's rude."

00:27:13.452 --> 00:27:15.221
- That's very rude.

00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:16.789
- Morning, Nan.

00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:21.360
- I didn't know.
I would've stopped it.

00:27:22.695 --> 00:27:24.730
Always at night,

00:27:24.997 --> 00:27:27.366
creeping around,
hidden in the shadows.

00:27:27.399 --> 00:27:28.801
- Oh yeah.

00:28:01.967 --> 00:28:03.335
- It's good to get
out the house for a bit.

00:28:03.369 --> 00:28:05.171
What do you reckon, Nan?

00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:10.342
Do you remember we used to
pick the fruit off the trees?

00:28:10.544 --> 00:28:12.745
- I'm not supposed
to be out here.

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:15.347
- Yeah, course you are, Nan,
it's your garden.

00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:18.817
- Oh, sweet birdies.

00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:21.153
- Yeah, they're lovely.

00:28:21.187 --> 00:28:23.889
- They fly wherever they want.

00:28:24.056 --> 00:28:26.458
Free to see everything.

00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:28.260
- Yeah, they do.

00:28:28.294 --> 00:28:30.229
- Little birds.

00:28:32.298 --> 00:28:33.933
- Lovely.

00:28:34.266 --> 00:28:36.101
Alright, come on.

00:28:39.205 --> 00:28:41.740
- Maggie loved this garden.

00:28:43.042 --> 00:28:46.312
She used to play
hopscotch just over there.

00:28:46.478 --> 00:28:48.881
Drew on the stones with chalk.

00:28:49.949 --> 00:28:52.284
- What was she like?
My mother?

00:28:52.484 --> 00:28:54.987
- My sweet Maggie.

00:28:55.555 --> 00:28:58.023
She loved your father.

00:28:58.324 --> 00:29:00.893
She would've
loved you even more.

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:05.130
When she was ten
or maybe eleven...

00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:13.872
She tried to run away.

00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:18.444
She was gone for a day or two,
I was worried sick.

00:29:19.979 --> 00:29:24.049
William found her,
hiding in the orchard.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.418
She'd been eating the fruit.

00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:28.854
William adores her.

00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:32.157
- Nan. Grandad, he's--

00:29:32.191 --> 00:29:36.529
- I wish he'd visit more often
but he's a very busy man.

00:29:39.098 --> 00:29:41.333
Keeps an eye on
the house, though.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.805
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

00:29:48.374 --> 00:29:52.478
- Nan. Grandad, he's...

00:29:52.746 --> 00:29:56.115
He died. Long time ago.

00:29:57.483 --> 00:30:00.853
Just after mum, when I was born.
You remember.

00:30:01.487 --> 00:30:03.922
- He loved her.

00:30:04.591 --> 00:30:06.425
We both did.

00:30:08.961 --> 00:30:11.797
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

00:30:13.332 --> 00:30:14.867
- Why?

00:30:16.902 --> 00:30:20.372
- Little birds see everything.

00:30:34.153 --> 00:30:37.323
Oh... oh... oh...

00:30:39.491 --> 00:30:41.126
- What is it, Nan?

00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:43.462
- Look.

00:30:46.332 --> 00:30:47.399
- There's nothing there, Nan.

00:30:49.736 --> 00:30:51.937
- Let me
get you back inside, okay.

00:31:30.008 --> 00:31:32.945
- Let's see if you're
going to work today.

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:36.081
Ooh!

00:32:33.873 --> 00:32:36.975
- <i>No, that's not fair.</i>
<i>You said you wouldn't.</i>

00:32:38.043 --> 00:32:40.245
<i>Please don't.</i>

00:32:40.946 --> 00:32:46.084
<i>I won't say anything.</i>
<i>I won't talk.</i>

00:32:46.586 --> 00:32:48.053
<i>No!</i>

00:32:48.086 --> 00:32:50.189
<i>No, you listen to me for once.</i>

00:32:50.222 --> 00:32:51.691
<i>Stay away from her.</i>

00:32:59.064 --> 00:32:59.833
- Ah!

00:33:00.232 --> 00:33:03.335
- <i>I won't let you.</i>
<i>You've done enough.</i>

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:07.439
<i>Leave her alone.</i>
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:10.108
<i>Leave her alone.</i>
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

00:33:11.109 --> 00:33:13.613
- Ah, bloody thing.

00:33:13.813 --> 00:33:15.013
- You didn't hear her?

00:33:15.047 --> 00:33:16.448
- Hear what?

00:33:16.616 --> 00:33:18.283
Anna, what's happening?

00:33:24.724 --> 00:33:26.191
- What's happening?

00:33:26.693 --> 00:33:28.460
- I heard her talking.

00:33:28.661 --> 00:33:30.530
- Well, she does
talk to herself sometimes.

00:33:30.563 --> 00:33:33.398
- No, I mean there was
someone in here with her.

00:33:33.666 --> 00:33:36.235
I heard another voice, Karen.

00:33:36.401 --> 00:33:37.402
Excuse me.

00:33:49.414 --> 00:33:51.250
So you didn't hear anything?

00:33:51.283 --> 00:33:52.519
- Well no,
I mean I was hoovering,

00:33:52.552 --> 00:33:54.052
I was trying to hoover.

00:33:54.086 --> 00:33:55.420
- I just, I don't understand,

00:33:55.454 --> 00:33:57.790
I heard another voice
on the receiver, I know I did.

00:33:57.824 --> 00:33:59.759
- Maybe it picked up
a radio station or something.

00:33:59.792 --> 00:34:01.493
I mean, that thing's
got to be as old as the house,

00:34:01.528 --> 00:34:03.495
I'm surprised it works at all.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:06.298
- Yeah, maybe. I--

00:34:06.666 --> 00:34:10.202
- And you know,
it might sound silly,

00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:12.705
but the first few days in this
house are bound to be muddling.

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:17.109
Your gran's symptoms
can really mess with your head.

00:34:17.276 --> 00:34:19.077
Yeah.

00:34:19.879 --> 00:34:21.748
Look at you you're freezing.
- Yeah.

00:34:21.781 --> 00:34:23.816
- Go and get warm
and dry, darling.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.683
<i>So sudden.</i>

00:34:57.215 --> 00:34:59.652
At least it felt sudden.

00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:04.857
But I wasn't ready
to lose Dad you know?

00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:06.693
- Yeah, I know.

00:35:07.392 --> 00:35:11.496
I don't think
you can ever really be ready.

00:35:12.097 --> 00:35:17.870
Both my parents faded slowly
so I had ages to prepare,

00:35:17.904 --> 00:35:21.741
but it's still
devastating when they die.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.514
- When I was about
twelve or thirteen

00:35:28.548 --> 00:35:32.785
I had this pet goldfish.

00:35:34.186 --> 00:35:35.922
I begged Dad
for weeks to get one

00:35:35.955 --> 00:35:37.456
and finally he gave in.

00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:40.192
I called him Nibbles,

00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:43.563
because he used to eat
the food out of my hand.

00:35:43.763 --> 00:35:49.301
One day I came home
and Nibbles just seemed strange.

00:35:49.334 --> 00:35:51.537
My-- A goldfish.
It was a goldfish,

00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:55.474
but something
just seemed different.

00:35:55.642 --> 00:36:00.445
Well, a couple of months ago,
about a week before Dad passed,

00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:04.817
he told me that one day
whilst I was at school,

00:36:04.851 --> 00:36:06.886
Nibbles had died.

00:36:07.053 --> 00:36:09.454
He found him floating
at the top of the tank,

00:36:09.488 --> 00:36:11.223
but instead of telling me,

00:36:11.256 --> 00:36:13.392
he went out
and bought another fish,

00:36:13.626 --> 00:36:15.595
buried Nibbles
in the back garden,

00:36:15.628 --> 00:36:16.696
covered up his death

00:36:16.729 --> 00:36:19.899
and kept it a secret from me
for over twenty years.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.936
Because he knew how
devastated I would've been.

00:36:25.437 --> 00:36:27.305
- Your gran talks about
your dad all the time,

00:36:27.339 --> 00:36:28.941
your mum too, actually.

00:36:29.809 --> 00:36:32.645
- She keeps mistaking me
for her which is weird.

00:36:34.547 --> 00:36:39.952
Knowing that my life
caused her death

00:36:40.352 --> 00:36:42.789
has always kind of
haunted me really.

00:36:42.822 --> 00:36:44.456
- No, Anna, no.

00:36:44.489 --> 00:36:47.694
You can't,
you can't think of it like that.

00:36:48.427 --> 00:36:50.596
- It's hard not to,
though really.

00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:53.533
- From what your
gran says to me,

00:36:53.566 --> 00:36:55.434
you know, your mum and dad,

00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:58.738
they wanted you more than
anything else in the world.

00:37:00.707 --> 00:37:02.274
- Yeah.

00:37:24.296 --> 00:37:25.832
- Isn't that amazing?

00:37:42.582 --> 00:37:46.251
- Whenever I hear that sound
it sends a shiver down my spine.

00:37:46.384 --> 00:37:50.556
Makes me think that Dad
is still watching over me.

00:37:51.323 --> 00:37:52.959
Silly, I know.

00:37:53.893 --> 00:37:55.661
- Not silly.

00:37:56.028 --> 00:37:59.966
You must be
still just awash with grief

00:37:59.999 --> 00:38:02.869
and there's
no deadline for that.

00:38:05.104 --> 00:38:10.342
- I just feel really lost
without him, you know?

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.348
Do you believe in
life after death--

00:38:22.354 --> 00:38:25.357
- Ah! Uh! Beast!

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.059
Oh, this house will
be the death of me.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.596
More wine, right now.

00:38:31.597 --> 00:38:32.999
Oh, wow.

00:38:34.634 --> 00:38:36.602
Bye, love. See you tomorrow.

00:40:33.619 --> 00:40:35.054
Nana?

00:40:37.123 --> 00:40:38.958
Is that you?

00:41:15.962 --> 00:41:19.598
♪ <i>A love no one understands</i>

00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:18.591
Nan?

00:42:22.328 --> 00:42:25.865
Let's get you back to bed, okay?

00:42:30.202 --> 00:42:32.805
It's not safe
for you to be out...

00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:16.942
- <i>Anna?</i>

00:44:19.678 --> 00:44:21.914
<i>Anna, are you there?</i>

00:44:33.859 --> 00:44:35.294
He's here.

00:44:43.502 --> 00:44:45.838
<i>I think I'm losing my mind.</i>

00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:47.406
- No, you're not.

00:44:47.574 --> 00:44:50.209
You're just really,
really tired.

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:53.879
And stress can do really
curious things to us, too.

00:44:53.979 --> 00:44:55.848
<i>But what you've got to remember,</i>

00:44:55.881 --> 00:44:56.916
<i>is that most of the time</i>

00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:59.051
<i>she's kind of in a world</i>
<i>of her own, you know,</i>

00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:01.720
<i>and what seems like</i>
<i>weird behavior to us</i>

00:45:01.754 --> 00:45:04.056
<i>is perfectly normal to her</i>
<i>and if we try to correct it</i>

00:45:04.089 --> 00:45:06.392
<i>or question her,</i>
<i>it's like saying to her</i>

00:45:06.425 --> 00:45:08.894
<i>that everything</i>
<i>she knows is a lie.</i>

00:45:10.229 --> 00:45:13.866
- I just don't want
to be in this house.

00:45:13.899 --> 00:45:15.234
- No.

00:45:15.334 --> 00:45:18.170
- I've never liked it
and I don't even know why.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.944
I need to be here for Nan.

00:45:24.977 --> 00:45:28.180
I want to keep her safe
and I love her so much,

00:45:28.214 --> 00:45:29.848
and I don't--

00:45:29.882 --> 00:45:31.050
- Do you want me
to stay tonight?

00:45:31.083 --> 00:45:32.384
Would that be a thing?
- Oh god, would you?

00:45:32.418 --> 00:45:35.154
- Yes. Of course I would.

00:45:36.322 --> 00:45:38.924
- Okay.
- It's okay, it's okay.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:26.005
- Karen?

00:47:07.279 --> 00:47:10.816
- That hairstyle
was all the rage back then.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:13.018
- It really suited you, Nan.

00:47:13.052 --> 00:47:15.220
- Young and care free.

00:47:15.689 --> 00:47:18.290
Old and cared for now.

00:47:18.457 --> 00:47:20.125
- Happens to the best of us.

00:47:22.094 --> 00:47:25.364
- Oh. Little Anna.

00:47:26.332 --> 00:47:28.434
Just like her mother.

00:47:28.735 --> 00:47:32.371
- I remember that
rope swing in the garden.

00:47:33.339 --> 00:47:36.208
- <i>Your father climbed</i>
<i>to the very top of that tree</i>

00:47:36.241 --> 00:47:38.410
<i>so you could have</i>
<i>a swing in the garden.</i>

00:47:39.144 --> 00:47:42.281
Up and up he went,
until I could hardly see him.

00:47:42.314 --> 00:47:44.983
I was terrified
he was going to fall.

00:47:45.918 --> 00:47:48.187
You were the apple of his eye.

00:47:48.487 --> 00:47:51.090
He would've done
anything for you.

00:47:59.699 --> 00:48:01.500
So innocent.

00:48:03.302 --> 00:48:05.137
I should've...

00:48:06.438 --> 00:48:07.973
- Should've what, Nan?

00:48:09.609 --> 00:48:12.344
- I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

00:48:12.812 --> 00:48:15.381
- You're not supposed to
talk about what, Nan?

00:48:19.318 --> 00:48:20.919
- Oh.

00:48:36.368 --> 00:48:38.203
No!

00:48:39.238 --> 00:48:40.105
- Nan?

00:48:40.205 --> 00:48:42.975
Nan? Nan?

00:48:43.108 --> 00:48:45.310
Nan! Nan!!

00:48:45.411 --> 00:48:47.913
Nan, stop! Nan!

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.650
Stop!
Nan, please stop!

00:48:51.016 --> 00:48:53.185
Nan, stop please!
- No!

00:48:53.218 --> 00:48:55.320
- Calm down.
Nan, please.

00:48:55.354 --> 00:48:57.657
- No! No! No!!
- Nan, please! Stop!

00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:00.092
Look at me,
you're going to hurt yourself.

00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:03.630
Stop, please!
- Leave! Leave!

00:49:03.663 --> 00:49:05.297
- Nan.
- Leave! Leave!

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.666
- It's okay. It's okay, Lucy.

00:49:06.699 --> 00:49:08.601
It's okay, Lucy.
- You have to leave!

00:49:08.635 --> 00:49:10.969
- It's okay, Lucy.
It's okay, love.

00:49:11.003 --> 00:49:12.672
Try to calm down.
- You have to leave!

00:49:12.772 --> 00:49:16.475
No, no she has to go!
No, no, no, no...

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.523
Hello.

00:50:38.457 --> 00:50:40.392
- I didn't mean to startle you.

00:50:41.828 --> 00:50:43.530
- No, it's okay.

00:50:43.796 --> 00:50:45.163
- It's Anna, isn't it?

00:50:45.197 --> 00:50:46.766
- Yeah, that's right.

00:50:47.366 --> 00:50:49.736
- Well, I haven't seen you in...

00:50:50.135 --> 00:50:53.673
I don't know,
it must be twenty years.

00:50:53.773 --> 00:50:56.475
- I'm sorry I haven't
been over to say hello.

00:50:56.576 --> 00:50:58.645
- It's not a sin to be busy.

00:50:59.478 --> 00:51:00.647
How's your grandmother?

00:51:02.649 --> 00:51:06.318
- Yeah, she's, erm, managing.

00:51:06.418 --> 00:51:09.121
That's why I'm back
to help look after her.

00:51:09.556 --> 00:51:11.524
Although I don't know
how much I'm actually helping.

00:51:11.858 --> 00:51:14.561
- I'm sure she's
very happy to have you here.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.297
Spending time with loved ones
is always a blessing,

00:51:18.698 --> 00:51:20.733
especially as we get older.

00:51:21.601 --> 00:51:24.236
At least your mother
is always nearby.

00:51:25.004 --> 00:51:27.674
I imagine Lucy
finds comfort in that.

00:51:28.073 --> 00:51:31.644
And your grandfather, too.

00:51:33.178 --> 00:51:35.682
I'm sure William
is looking over the house,

00:51:35.982 --> 00:51:38.618
despite the circumstances.

00:51:39.819 --> 00:51:41.286
- Circumstances?

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.823
- That he could
see no other way.

00:51:44.657 --> 00:51:46.224
Such a tragedy.

00:51:47.827 --> 00:51:49.696
- What do you mean?

00:51:50.128 --> 00:51:52.297
- Well, I thought...

00:51:55.467 --> 00:51:59.338
It's not my place.
- No, please.

00:52:02.307 --> 00:52:04.510
- Your grandfather...

00:52:05.778 --> 00:52:07.747
took his own life.

00:52:11.249 --> 00:52:13.586
- No. No, he didn't.

00:52:15.722 --> 00:52:18.625
- I'm so sorry, Anna.

00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:21.661
I presumed you knew.

00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:23.763
- But that's not true.

00:52:23.796 --> 00:52:27.634
He... he died
from a heart attack

00:52:27.667 --> 00:52:30.502
from the stress
of my mother's death.

00:52:31.136 --> 00:52:33.706
I think William
was so overcome with sadness

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.542
that he felt
there was no other choice.

00:52:38.343 --> 00:52:41.714
You mother's death
was too much for him.

00:55:06.959 --> 00:55:08.393
Karen?

00:55:14.934 --> 00:55:16.536
Karen?

00:55:18.838 --> 00:55:20.740
Where are you?

00:55:31.117 --> 00:55:33.986
Come on. Come on.

00:56:05.417 --> 00:56:06.853
Nan?

00:56:10.056 --> 00:56:11.958
Oh my god.

00:56:32.945 --> 00:56:34.479
Nan?

00:56:42.555 --> 00:56:43.990
Nan?

00:56:55.868 --> 00:56:57.069
Nana?

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:02.108
Nana?

00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:07.146
Lucy?

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.055
Nana? Nan?

00:57:16.188 --> 00:57:17.890
Nan?

00:57:18.057 --> 00:57:19.125
Nan?!

00:57:19.392 --> 00:57:22.061
Nan?!

00:57:22.427 --> 00:57:25.064
Nan!
Nan, is that you?

00:57:25.698 --> 00:57:26.565
Nan?

00:57:28.534 --> 00:57:29.467
Ah!

00:57:44.283 --> 00:57:45.851
- Oh...

00:58:32.865 --> 00:58:35.868
- Lucy, it's Karen.
Are you okay?

00:58:46.045 --> 00:58:48.547
- Help! Help!

00:58:48.647 --> 00:58:51.817
Nan! Karen! Help!

00:58:52.585 --> 00:58:56.589
Help! Nana! Karen!

00:58:58.891 --> 00:59:00.259
- Lucy?

00:59:04.797 --> 00:59:06.132
- Help!

00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:13.239
- Anna, are you in here?

00:59:17.176 --> 00:59:18.677
Lucy?

00:59:18.778 --> 00:59:20.679
Is that you, my love?

00:59:32.024 --> 00:59:33.592
- Oh, Anna.

00:59:33.726 --> 00:59:36.228
If this is you being jokey,
it's not funny.

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:53.212
<i>Anna!</i>

00:59:56.649 --> 00:59:58.017
- Who's there?

01:00:09.795 --> 01:00:13.132
- Oh! Oh! Oh god, Lucy.

01:00:13.165 --> 01:00:15.901
Oh, Lucy. Darling.

01:00:16.102 --> 01:00:17.837
Where have you been?

01:00:18.104 --> 01:00:21.006
- He's here.

01:00:43.996 --> 01:00:46.298
- Oh god.

01:00:51.971 --> 01:00:53.305
What...

01:01:14.393 --> 01:01:16.262
- Oh, Anna.
Oh my god.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.364
Oh my god, Anna. Anna.

01:01:18.664 --> 01:01:21.066
Are you okay?
Come on.

01:01:26.205 --> 01:01:27.273
Anna. Anna.

01:01:27.306 --> 01:01:28.741
Come on.

01:01:28.774 --> 01:01:30.376
Come on, baby.
Up we go.

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:33.879
It's alright.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.249
Why's the car on?
Why's the car on, darling?

01:01:37.283 --> 01:01:38.984
Why's the car on?

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.521
Oh god, Anna.

01:01:41.555 --> 01:01:43.455
What's happening, sweetheart?
- Where's Nana?

01:01:43.489 --> 01:01:45.191
- She's upstairs.

01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:51.830
- Sweetheart.
Why was the car on, darling?

01:01:52.164 --> 01:01:53.199
Sweetheart.

01:01:53.232 --> 01:01:54.233
Stop.

01:01:54.266 --> 01:01:56.001
What's happening?!

01:01:56.402 --> 01:01:59.506
- There is something
happening in this house,

01:01:59.539 --> 01:02:02.741
and I don't know what it is,
and I can't explain it,

01:02:02.775 --> 01:02:04.310
but Nana
knows something about it.

01:02:04.343 --> 01:02:06.412
- Sweetheart, darling,

01:02:06.445 --> 01:02:07.947
now I know
you've been stressed.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.282
- Stressed?! Stressed?

01:02:10.316 --> 01:02:13.152
You think stress
locked me in the garage?

01:02:13.185 --> 01:02:15.354
Come on on, Karen,
she knows something.

01:02:15.387 --> 01:02:17.790
I think she's been trying
to tell us this whole time,

01:02:17.823 --> 01:02:21.026
and we've just dismissed it
because of her illness.

01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:48.454
It's Dad. It's Dad.

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:01.534
Anna! Anna! Anna!

01:03:28.994 --> 01:03:31.363
<i>The wallpaper's changed.</i>

01:03:31.698 --> 01:03:33.566
- <i>We're at Karen's house.</i>

01:03:33.932 --> 01:03:36.135
- I know where we are.

01:03:36.969 --> 01:03:41.240
The wallpaper used to be yellow,
it was better then.

01:03:43.442 --> 01:03:46.345
Karen said we can
stay here for a little while.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.582
- Well, how long are we staying?

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:52.084
- I don't know, Nan.

01:03:53.452 --> 01:03:56.055
- Can we see
the birds again soon?

01:03:56.155 --> 01:03:58.891
- Karen probably has birds
that visit her garden.

01:03:59.124 --> 01:04:04.330
- They fly wherever they want,
but they always come back.

01:04:08.901 --> 01:04:10.169
- Nan...

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:16.008
I have to ask you something
and it might upset you, okay?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.617
I know about Grandad,
about what he did.

01:04:28.187 --> 01:04:30.557
- What he did?

01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:34.159
- Taking his own life, Nan.

01:04:37.196 --> 01:04:41.568
Was it something to do with Mum,
because she died?

01:04:43.703 --> 01:04:47.172
- You remind me
of her so much.

01:04:52.512 --> 01:04:54.046
I didn't know.

01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:57.082
- You didn't know what, Nan?

01:05:11.196 --> 01:05:12.998
- William was sick.

01:05:13.232 --> 01:05:14.500
He...

01:05:16.368 --> 01:05:17.570
he...

01:05:17.903 --> 01:05:21.641
hurt our little girl.

01:05:37.022 --> 01:05:38.290
I didn't know.

01:05:40.325 --> 01:05:43.061
I didn't know
until it was too late.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.004
I never would've
let him hurt my Maggie.

01:06:25.605 --> 01:06:29.341
When your mother died...

01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:33.513
...your father learnt the truth.

01:06:51.698 --> 01:06:53.131
She was your daughter.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.200
Your daughter!

01:06:57.336 --> 01:06:58.505
You're sick!!

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:07.045
- Mum's death...

01:07:09.114 --> 01:07:10.282
My birth...

01:07:12.284 --> 01:07:14.186
It exposed him.

01:07:16.154 --> 01:07:19.759
- My daughter
won't ever know you exist.

01:07:21.628 --> 01:07:24.664
You're never coming near Anna!

01:07:28.735 --> 01:07:30.369
- His secret was out.

01:07:31.336 --> 01:07:33.272
<i>He got blind drunk.</i>

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.817
- He got drunk and killed
himself after Maggie's funeral,

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.119
because he was a coward.

01:08:52.552 --> 01:08:56.689
- William destroyed our family.

01:08:58.825 --> 01:09:00.526
- Nan.

01:09:20.546 --> 01:09:24.483
- <i>"Behold, I was</i>
<i>brought forth in iniquity,</i>

01:09:24.684 --> 01:09:28.387
<i>and in sin</i>
<i>my mother conceived me."</i>

01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:33.492
We are all born
with the capacity to sin,

01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.428
but each one of us
is ultimately responsible

01:09:36.461 --> 01:09:38.765
for our own sins

01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:41.701
and for the choices we make.

01:09:43.235 --> 01:09:48.508
God said,
"Let us make man in our image,

01:09:48.608 --> 01:09:50.877
after our likeness."

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:54.580
"And let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

01:09:54.614 --> 01:09:56.281
"the birds of the heavens,

01:09:56.314 --> 01:10:01.788
and every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth."

01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:07.359
Dominion, an interesting word...

01:10:07.627 --> 01:10:13.198
power and control,
the authority to rule over.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.005
Dominion implies ownership,
the power to impose our will,

01:10:19.038 --> 01:10:23.341
to exploit
for self-serving desires.

01:10:23.976 --> 01:10:27.947
It is none of these things.

01:10:28.213 --> 01:10:32.018
Having dominion over something
is a grave responsibility,

01:10:32.051 --> 01:10:35.588
the responsibility
not to impose our power,

01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:41.426
but to allow all living things
the choice to be good.

01:10:42.294 --> 01:10:45.832
What makes us human
is not being good,

01:10:45.865 --> 01:10:48.801
but choosing to be good.

01:10:49.135 --> 01:10:53.806
Choosing to reject evil
and repent our sins.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:59.612
Choosing wisdom over fear,
love over hate,

01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:07.352
because through wisdom and love
all things are possible.

01:11:07.887 --> 01:11:11.323
When we recognize
our sins and repent,

01:11:11.356 --> 01:11:17.329
only then are we free
to move forward,

01:11:17.496 --> 01:11:19.264
be at peace,

01:11:19.832 --> 01:11:24.336
and live in
the light of God's love.

in church, Anna.

01:11:48.995 --> 01:11:51.030
May I?
- Please.

01:11:59.739 --> 01:12:01.674
Do you believe in evil?

01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:07.312
- Well, yes.
I somewhat have to.

01:12:08.714 --> 01:12:11.717
Good goes hand in hand with bad.

01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:16.823
If I believe in God, I have to
believe in the other guy.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:22.995
I have no doubt
evil exists in this world.

01:12:25.631 --> 01:12:27.365
- I need your help.

01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.650
- Anna, you're obviously
under a lot of pressure.

01:12:45.318 --> 01:12:48.154
Looking after someone
like your grandmother,

01:12:48.187 --> 01:12:49.956
with her symptoms,

01:12:50.256 --> 01:12:53.960
it's a very stressful situation.

01:12:55.862 --> 01:12:57.697
If you're happy to,

01:12:58.396 --> 01:13:00.933
I'd like us to pray together.

01:13:37.904 --> 01:13:39.572
- <i>What happens now?</i>

01:13:41.173 --> 01:13:43.142
- I do not know.

01:13:49.749 --> 01:13:51.483
- I'm so sorry
I was a bit dismissive,

01:13:51.517 --> 01:13:53.686
I know I shouldn't have been,
and I'm so sorry.

01:13:54.452 --> 01:13:56.722
- I wouldn't have
believed me, either.

01:13:58.190 --> 01:14:00.927
- With your dad's death
and your gran's condition,

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.828
I just thought you were--
- Stressed.

01:14:02.862 --> 01:14:03.863
- Yeah.

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:08.500
- Karen, you of all people do
not need to apologize to me.

01:14:08.601 --> 01:14:11.003
I don't know what
I would've done without you.

01:14:13.806 --> 01:14:16.943
- Your gran's right,
you're so like your mum.

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:18.644
She used to babysit me,
you know?

01:14:18.678 --> 01:14:19.845
- Mum did?
- Yeah.

01:14:21.647 --> 01:14:23.916
You know, thinking about it now.

01:14:24.216 --> 01:14:25.985
She always seemed
to be so relieved

01:14:26.018 --> 01:14:27.920
to get away from the house.

01:14:28.788 --> 01:14:31.824
Can't even begin to imagine
what she was going through.

01:14:33.526 --> 01:14:36.862
William was such a stern man,
he was scary,

01:14:36.896 --> 01:14:39.732
he used to scare me actually,
but...

01:14:45.104 --> 01:14:45.972
You know you can stay here

01:14:46.005 --> 01:14:48.040
for as long as you need to,
don't you?

01:15:12.965 --> 01:15:16.268
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.
It's okay, Nan.

01:15:33.586 --> 01:15:35.621
- It's okay, Nan.

01:15:44.864 --> 01:15:46.132
Nan?

01:15:47.066 --> 01:15:48.634
Nan?

01:15:48.934 --> 01:15:49.902
Nan?

01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:51.337
- I mean,
I was downstairs the whole time,

01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:53.773
I just don't know
how she got past me.

01:15:53.873 --> 01:15:57.143
- No, it's fine.
We just need to find her.

01:16:09.922 --> 01:16:11.690
Oh my god.

01:16:24.203 --> 01:16:25.738
- Just in case.
- Okay.

01:16:26.705 --> 01:16:28.741
Nan?
- Lucy?

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:32.745
- Nana?
- Lucy?

01:16:32.778 --> 01:16:35.848
- Nana?
- It's only us, darling.

01:16:36.749 --> 01:16:38.117
Lucy?

01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:43.249
- It's my fault.

01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:45.784
- Oh, Nan.

01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:00.966
Here you go, Nan.

01:18:01.901 --> 01:18:03.769
We can't stay here.

01:18:26.192 --> 01:18:28.360
- We have to go, now.

01:18:29.228 --> 01:18:30.896
- Fine by me.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.798
It's alright, sweetheart.

01:18:35.201 --> 01:18:36.835
This way, darling.

01:18:37.069 --> 01:18:38.704
- No!

01:18:40.439 --> 01:18:42.174
Leave them alone.

01:18:42.274 --> 01:18:43.943
Just take me.

01:18:44.243 --> 01:18:45.277
- Lucy!

01:18:46.245 --> 01:18:49.782
- Just take me. Just take me.

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:51.984
- I've got you.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:56.488
- Okay, this way.
It's okay.

01:18:58.558 --> 01:18:59.892
It's alright, sweetheart.

01:19:01.327 --> 01:19:03.495
Anna, we've got to
get her in the chair.

01:19:03.963 --> 01:19:04.830
I'll get the door.

01:19:04.863 --> 01:19:06.832
- Here you go, Nan.
I've got you now.

01:19:13.872 --> 01:19:15.107
I've got it.

01:19:16.141 --> 01:19:18.344
Come on! Come on!!

01:19:20.446 --> 01:19:22.081
- Karen! Karen.

01:19:22.314 --> 01:19:24.083
Karen, can you hear me?
Karen?

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.252
Karen...

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:43.369
- You hurt our little girl.

01:20:33.653 --> 01:20:35.988
- Leave us alone!

01:20:39.024 --> 01:20:42.428
- William, you were
supposed to protect us,

01:20:42.461 --> 01:20:45.331
but you destroyed out family.

01:20:45.464 --> 01:20:46.899
I hate you.

01:21:17.262 --> 01:21:18.897
- No!

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.942
- Stop.

01:21:52.565 --> 01:21:54.534
- She was your daughter.

01:21:54.667 --> 01:21:56.001
Your daughter!

01:21:57.604 --> 01:21:59.171
You're sick!

01:22:15.454 --> 01:22:18.323
- Please stop.

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:22.127
I buried my daughter today.

01:22:23.495 --> 01:22:24.963
- Tell her.

01:22:25.765 --> 01:22:27.199
- Tell me what?

01:22:43.415 --> 01:22:45.451
No. Oh...

01:23:06.438 --> 01:23:08.006
- William?

01:23:12.712 --> 01:23:14.681
It isn't true, is it?

01:23:26.759 --> 01:23:27.760
- William.

01:24:25.718 --> 01:24:27.452
Lucy.

01:26:29.441 --> 01:26:30.576
Lucy?

01:26:33.445 --> 01:26:34.747
- No!

01:26:35.414 --> 01:26:36.549
- Lucy!

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.254
Lucy!

01:26:49.829 --> 01:26:51.864
- Lucy!

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.917
Lucy.

01:27:47.954 --> 01:27:49.555
What?

01:27:55.094 --> 01:28:00.666
Somehow, despite you,
my mother found happiness.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:04.003
I'm living proof
of my parents love, real love,

01:28:04.036 --> 01:28:06.471
not the sick ordeal
you put her through,

01:28:06.506 --> 01:28:08.273
you deserve to die.

01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:12.344
No! You do not get to
play this song anymore.

01:28:24.524 --> 01:28:26.358
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:26.859 --> 01:28:28.761
- What was Mum like?

01:28:33.398 --> 01:28:35.400
- Your mother was beautiful,

01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.335
and clever,

01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:39.605
kind,

01:28:41.473 --> 01:28:44.544
and so brave,
just like you.

Nan. Nan.

01:29:05.832 --> 01:29:07.667
Oh, Nan.

01:29:17.143 --> 01:29:18.778
No, Nan.

01:29:19.178 --> 01:29:21.848
Oh, no. No, no.
