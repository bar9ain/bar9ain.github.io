(LAUGHS)

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.781
Little Thunder was just here!

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.300
And I helped him!

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.504
oh!

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.144
I so much hope to see him again.

I'm a big eagle.

Your totem, your protector.

Wherever you go, I go too.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.101
wow!

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.064
It was very generous that you saved Little Thunder.

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.144
Do you think we both will become friends at some point?

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.427
and riding through the prairie?

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.188
For your courage and kindness

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.387
I give you my most beautiful feather.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.345

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.064
Thank you, Big Eagle.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.269
Such feathers are worn by the brave of the tribe!

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.588
Does that mean I'm one of the brave ones now?

Everyone who knows how to live in peace with all living beings

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.942
and respect for them is courageous.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.946
But I want to give you something else.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.780
Something that no one has ever owned before.

You give me something else?

Just such a feather are worn by all the brave!

Yes, great, Yakari, but let's go home now.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.110
what? Aah!

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.784
Yakari!

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.150
Hey, I understood what you just said.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.780
And every word!

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.822
You are right! And so do I!

Do you know what that means?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.270
Uh, yes. We go back to the tribe?

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.507
no! (LAUGHS)

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.703
That means I can talk to Little Thunder!

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.062
Hey! This is not the way to the village!

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.028
The trail of Little Thunder ends here on this stone path.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.421
He certainly ran into the forest.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.146
You don't want to go in there! There are wild beasts in the forest!

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:33.949
I have to talk to him!

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:38.190
You can be dogish, but maybe not a horse!

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.343
YAKARI: There are no traces here.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.304
I can ask the other forest dwellers.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.862
Then we see if other animals understand me.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.029
Other animals? Do you mean the beasts?

Beep, beep, do you see the little man?

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.629
What does he do alone in the forest?

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.426
And this dog doesn't look like he can protect him!

real? We can't leave without Yakari!

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:37.780
The trunk must break up quickly.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.903
Soon the Great Winds will move through this area.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.421
Little badger and I want to help find Yakari.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.587
yes! uh... what?

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.540
No, you stay here, the tribe needs help moving.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.743
The search for Yakari could become dangerous.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.943
yes! He is absolutely right.

I think I'm dreaming! It's fantastic, rodent!

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:07.590
And what do you call it? "Cutting teeth with beaver"?

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:11.548
All immediately to the dam! Make it!

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.821
oh! What a disaster!

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.990
This will take a long time for our dam to work again!

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.310
Don't you see?

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.144
To work! lot!

Quite quietly, a thousand mouths.

Hello, beaver.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.582
Could you pull me out?

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.826
I think I'm standing in the woods! He speaks Beaver!

Hello! I am linden tree.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.939

YAKARI: All I know is how I cling to the tree,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.988
and then crash down the waterfall.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.866
No idea how long I've been driving along the river.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.629

How sad!

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.540
People also have parents?

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.061
Oh no! Where is my pen?

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.864
Ooh...

No one can catch Little Thunder.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.501
I just wanted us to be friends.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.509

Oh, Yakari.

Lindenbaum, what is to be that?

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:22.663
If I run like this, I will come to the dam later and the others are ready.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.384
From a distance, it looks like...

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.468

for I will never leave you.

Get out there, dwarf!

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:06.424
You are too small for a great hunter like me!

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:12.421
Little Thunder is my friend! No one is going to do anything to him!

But we have to get away from here! This Puma...

He's still somewhere here! - Puma?

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:34.344
oh! This was not a puma, this is a human being!

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:36.542
what? That is even worse.

help me catch the horse!

Come on! Be good, little Sioux!

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:32.062
Tell me where the horse is!

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.506
Then I will bring you home!

I bet it leads outside.
