00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:33.499
LOST & FOUND

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.540
-Hello?
-Hello.

00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:20.957
I'm looking for... Soon Huan Yue.

00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:23.415
No, I don't know him.

00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:26.457
I'm not from Immigration.
I have something for him.

00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:28.249
It's his.

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.499
Wait.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.582
My grandfather doesn't speak Spanish.

00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:02.457
"We lost it
when we moved here".

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:05.332
Someone found it in the street.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.457
I cleaned it up,
some parts were wet.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:16.332
It's his mother.

00:04:19.582 --> 00:04:20.582
He wants to compensate you.

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:22.749
No,

00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:25.249
it's my job.

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:32.373
Well, I'll get going.

00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:34.082
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.665
Okay. 'Bye.

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.332
LOST & FOUND

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.124
A large, black, fold-up umbrella,

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:07.124
lost on the 15th or 16th this month
on bus route 238.

00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:08.791
It must be this one.

00:05:09.874 --> 00:05:10.999
Is that it?

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.082
Yes, it is.

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:16.082
But that one's newer.
Can I take it instead?

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.374
No.

00:05:18.582 --> 00:05:19.415
Why not?

00:05:19.582 --> 00:05:20.832
This isn't a flea market, lady.

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.832
Sign here.

00:05:30.457 --> 00:05:33.457
Shit, it's like
the Great Flood out there!

00:05:34.624 --> 00:05:36.624
I just ran into Noah.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:40.666
What have you got for me?

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:44.082
"Morning, Elena, how are you?"
"Look, soaked to the skin".

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:45.540
Yeah, yeah, good morning.

00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:48.248
-Hello, Andrés.
-Hi, cutie.

00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:49.748
The standard:

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:51.374
wallets, cellphones,

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:54.874
a cookery book, fusion cuisine,

00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:58.374
a camera, one shoe,
the other one, who knows?

00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:01.832
Oh, yes, that's broken.

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.957
I'm sure you'll fix it.

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.374
An umbrella, of course.

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:07.999
And that...

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:10.707
looks like a gold bracelet.

00:06:10.874 --> 00:06:12.790
I'm not sure, but I think so.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.207
And a little jackpot.

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:18.165
What do you do with the cash?

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:21.249
The cash stays here.

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:24.041
By the way,
they're dragging the riverbed.

00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:27.291
Loads of shit is coming out.

00:06:27.457 --> 00:06:28.957
Shit that you like.

00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:31.166
The kind that gets you hot.

00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:38.457
Are we going out on Friday?

00:06:38.624 --> 00:06:40.415
20:307

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:43.999
I'm taking one. I'll bring it back.

00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:47.791
Seriously?

00:06:49.457 --> 00:06:52.707
Pen-pushers...
You're all the same.

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:29.415
Cellphones.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:31.165
Ms. Zumarraga?

00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:33.665
Hi, I'm calling from
Lost & Found South.

00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:35.582
We have your wallet and ID.

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:37.290
Yes, the police brought it.

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:40.748
Sure, you can't leave
your handbag lying around.

00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:42.749
Your wallet with the money too.

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:46.082
No, not 500 euros, no.
There were 40.

00:08:02.207 --> 00:08:05.082
-Alright, handsome...
-You're going?

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:09.415
Don't ruin your eyes.
And those cigarettes...

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:48.290
Hello, Pedro.

00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:51.707
How was your day?

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.123
I'm asking how you are.

00:08:56.749 --> 00:08:58.290
You're hungry. Me too.

00:08:58.457 --> 00:09:01.707
I'll change your water first,
it's a bit dirty, okay?

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:15.582
A traffic accident
left one person dead

00:09:15.749 --> 00:09:18.207
and an entire family
plunged into mourning.

00:09:18.666 --> 00:09:19.916
At first it appeared that

00:09:20.082 --> 00:09:22.665
the cause was the excess
of alcohol in Mary's blood,

00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:25.415
but after a more detailed analysis,

00:09:25.582 --> 00:09:28.582
a rather rare substance
found in one spot

00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:31.165
made the investigators look at it
from another viewpoint

00:09:31.332 --> 00:09:35.832
and question if it really
had been an accident.

00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:44.165
The Cunninghams were
a much-loved couple in Vermont.

00:09:44.499 --> 00:09:47.874
Mary owned one of the local bars.

00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:51.999
Carlos worked as a mailman
in the post office.

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:55.749
He enjoyed his job a lot,
it made him feel useful.

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:07.207
-Put it there.
-Up, up!

00:10:10.374 --> 00:10:11.749
That's it, down.

00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:14.832
Go!

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:17.290
That's it!
Stop!

00:10:21.332 --> 00:10:23.873
-What have we got here?
-Go, that's it.

00:10:24.124 --> 00:10:26.540
Straight to the end, this way.

00:12:57.707 --> 00:12:59.332
Are you okay?

00:13:02.416 --> 00:13:04.416
Were you working this late?

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:09.916
Inspector.

00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:16.416
The judge has finished,
you can go home.

00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:17.707
Any clues?

00:13:17.874 --> 00:13:20.207
From the state of the remains
it looks like it was under water

00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.374
for at least a couple of years.

00:13:23.207 --> 00:13:27.415
Probably some immigrant
with no papers, or a prostitute.

00:13:27.582 --> 00:13:30.290
She had a miscarriage
and got rid of the problem.

00:13:30.457 --> 00:13:31.498
Good night.

00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:33.874
-That doesn't fit.
-Mario, Mario.

00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.207
It doesn't fit.
It's an expensive suitcase, Helena.

00:13:36.416 --> 00:13:37.374
And?

00:13:39.416 --> 00:13:41.416
It's an unusual brand,
it's not sold in Spain.

00:13:41.582 --> 00:13:42.540
It doesn't fit.

00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:45.290
Maybe I could help you
with the investigation.

00:13:45.457 --> 00:13:48.165
Okay, we'll keep it in mind.

00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:51.166
Go on, off to bed, champ.

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:56.957
Relax, it's fine.

00:13:57.124 --> 00:13:59.124
Mario. Wait. Mario.

00:15:29.874 --> 00:15:30.957
TELEPHONE DIRECTORY

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:00.041
-Hi.
-Hi.

00:16:04.457 --> 00:16:06.415
-Is this your home?
-Yes.

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:07.791
Oh, yeah?

00:16:07.957 --> 00:16:11.082
Good.
Can I speak to your mother?

00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:15.166
Rebecca, go back inside.
What do you want?

00:16:15.332 --> 00:16:18.915
Good morning.
I'm from Lost & Found,

00:16:19.082 --> 00:16:21.248
I'm looking for Mrs. Valenzuela.

00:16:24.707 --> 00:16:26.248
Wait here.

00:16:37.207 --> 00:16:39.123
I have to go.

00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:40.999
We'll talk Monday, okay?

00:16:41.666 --> 00:16:42.874
Ciao.

00:16:47.416 --> 00:16:48.457
Good morning.

00:16:49.332 --> 00:16:50.582
Good morning.

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:54.207
Bibiana tells me
you're from Lost & Found.

00:16:54.374 --> 00:16:58.040
Yes. We found something
that may belong to you.

00:16:58.957 --> 00:17:01.373
I don't recall losing anything.

00:17:03.082 --> 00:17:04.290
It's a suitcase.

00:17:06.207 --> 00:17:08.415
A maroon suitcase,

00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:13.457
Sizze brand, the large model,

00:17:14.249 --> 00:17:16.832
with a combination lock.

00:17:17.332 --> 00:17:18.123
No.

00:17:18.291 --> 00:17:19.624
You must've lost it
a couple of years ago.

00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:21.374
They found it yesterday in the river.

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.665
No, there must be some mistake.

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.249
-This, does it look familiar?
-No.

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:38.748
I'm telling you, it's not mine.

00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:40.666
Your name was inside it.

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:45.832
It doesn't look familiar?
Are you sure?

00:17:47.207 --> 00:17:49.207
Maybe it was your husband's.
Raul Latorre, right?

00:17:49.374 --> 00:17:51.957
Raul died two years ago now.

00:17:53.832 --> 00:17:56.623
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thank you.

00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:59.291
So you don't know who Eva is?

00:18:00.207 --> 00:18:01.415
No.

00:18:04.957 --> 00:18:06.498
Anything else?

00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.915
-No. That was all.
-Good.

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:13.290
Bibiana will show you to the door.

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:15.165
Bibiana!

00:18:16.499 --> 00:18:17.874
A pleasure.

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:40.666
I don't know, he seemed quite sure.

00:18:42.374 --> 00:18:44.207
-What did you say?
-That I didn't know anything.

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:46.499
-Don't talk to anyone again.
-What if he calls the police?

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:48.291
Don't call here again. Ever!

00:19:00.249 --> 00:19:03.207
-Hotel Bickle. Hello?
-Hotel Bickle.

00:19:03.874 --> 00:19:05.624
Can I help you, sir?

00:19:07.374 --> 00:19:09.582
Could you remind me
of your address, please?

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:12.249
Calle Fernandez de Trava, 91.

00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:32.166
You can't go in.

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:47.915
What the hell are you doing there?
They're waiting for you.

00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:53.749
You too, come on.

00:20:36.957 --> 00:20:38.332
The autopsy results came in.

00:20:40.541 --> 00:20:44.166
It was a girl. Premature.
Around 8 months.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.791
The pathologist says
the skull deformation indicates birth.

00:20:50.957 --> 00:20:53.748
It's not know
if she was born alive, or...

00:20:57.249 --> 00:20:58.290
They're not going to investigate.

00:20:59.832 --> 00:21:01.540
You heard the inspector.

00:21:02.666 --> 00:21:03.666
What an ass.

00:21:04.916 --> 00:21:06.999
Yes, he's an ass.

00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:11.874
But he's a good fuck.

00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:14.791
You're an idiot too.

00:22:36.207 --> 00:22:38.165
First time in The Bickle?

00:22:38.332 --> 00:22:40.415
Yes. The Bickle, yes.

00:22:44.416 --> 00:22:46.416
Maybe you can help me.

00:22:50.207 --> 00:22:51.790
I'm looking for company.

00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.624
I'm on company expenses.

00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:04.124
Through the glass door.

00:23:28.166 --> 00:23:29.707
Good evening.

00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:33.624
Good evening.

00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:40.207
I'll need some ID.

00:23:57.166 --> 00:23:58.874
It's for your own safety.

00:24:00.916 --> 00:24:03.541
Your first time with us, Mr. Ba yat?

00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:07.998
Yes. A friend recommended it.

00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:09.749
A good friend, I hope.

00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:13.499
This way, please.

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:27.249
ENTER >

00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:07.541
Hello.

00:25:20.207 --> 00:25:21.498
Hi.

00:25:27.749 --> 00:25:30.707
I'm getting a drink, okay?

00:25:32.874 --> 00:25:35.415
-Want one?
-No.

00:25:36.832 --> 00:25:38.123
Are you new?

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:43.582
Yes. A business trip.

00:25:51.457 --> 00:25:53.623
I'm looking for a specific girl.

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:59.540
If you know her name,
I can ask her to join us.

00:25:59.707 --> 00:26:04.207
I only know she had a baby,
about two years ago.

00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:08.207
Are you a cop?

00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:09.999
No.

00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:12.749
A baby girl, called Eva.
Do you know her?

00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:18.624
I don't know anything.

00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:20.957
You do know her.

00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:23.332
Hold on, I'll give you my address.

00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.332
Wait.

00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:27.915
Hold on, please,
I just want to talk to her.

00:26:36.374 --> 00:26:38.040
It's about the baby.

00:26:38.207 --> 00:26:40.623
Tell her it's important, please.

00:26:41.416 --> 00:26:42.791
Please.

00:26:54.041 --> 00:26:56.957
...he did the autopsy

00:26:57.124 --> 00:26:59.999
after the fateful accident.

00:27:33.207 --> 00:27:34.790
It's Sunday. We're closed.

00:27:35.707 --> 00:27:37.790
I'm Eva's mother.

00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.249
Hello.

00:28:18.332 --> 00:28:19.415
Hello.

00:28:20.624 --> 00:28:22.290
What is this place?

00:28:22.457 --> 00:28:23.623
Well...

00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:26.624
It used to be the old station.
Now it's a Lost & Found warehouse.

00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:29.332
They used to hold auctions,

00:28:29.749 --> 00:28:32.915
but then... nothing.

00:28:33.082 --> 00:28:35.290
They forgot about this place
and now...

00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.166
...it all accumulates.

00:28:38.457 --> 00:28:40.498
Do you fix these things?

00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:44.207
It entertains me to give them
a new lease of life.

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:46.374
Excuse me,
be careful with that, it's drying.

00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:47.832
Sorry.

00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:10.499
I can't stay long.

00:29:12.749 --> 00:29:14.832
I just want to know how she is.

00:29:16.041 --> 00:29:17.291
Who?

00:29:17.874 --> 00:29:20.457
My girl. Eva.

00:29:21.332 --> 00:29:24.707
You told my friend you wanted
to talk to me about her.

00:29:29.957 --> 00:29:30.998
Is something the matter?

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:41.332
Did this belong to her?

00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:46.416
I made it for her.

00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:50.290
I wanted her to have
something from her mother.

00:29:57.541 --> 00:29:58.624
Are you the father?

00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:05.416
They've been dragging the riverbed.

00:30:05.582 --> 00:30:08.165
They're pulling out lots of things.

00:30:08.332 --> 00:30:10.873
The other day
they brought me a suitcase.

00:30:13.707 --> 00:30:16.040
It had been underwater
for a long time.

00:30:16.207 --> 00:30:17.665
When I opened it,

00:30:18.957 --> 00:30:20.957
I found this and...

00:30:22.791 --> 00:30:24.499
the skeleton of a baby.

00:30:47.082 --> 00:30:50.415
I'm sorry, really.
I just wanted to look into it.

00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:56.832
The police weren't going to
investigate it, so I thought

00:30:57.124 --> 00:30:58.707
that maybe I could find...

00:30:58.874 --> 00:31:00.582
It's not your fault.

00:31:00.749 --> 00:31:02.290
No.

00:31:10.499 --> 00:31:13.290
I only saw her for a few seconds.

00:31:16.749 --> 00:31:18.207
What's your name?

00:31:20.499 --> 00:31:21.915
Mario, my name's Mario.

00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:28.666
Mario.

00:31:29.582 --> 00:31:31.207
I'm Sara.

00:31:37.874 --> 00:31:40.290
Let me get you a coffee, okay?

00:32:33.707 --> 00:32:34.915
Everything okay?

00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:37.707
Sorry.

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.666
I don't feel well.

00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:43.040
Can I rest up today?

00:32:46.916 --> 00:32:48.499
Later.

00:32:49.832 --> 00:32:51.665
He's been waiting for half an hour.

00:32:54.916 --> 00:32:57.082
You'll have to make it up to him.

00:33:23.666 --> 00:33:25.082
Ever heard of the Hotel Bickle?

00:33:25.249 --> 00:33:27.457
A luxury hotel, downtown.
Does it ring a bell?

00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:29.124
Yes. It's a luxury hotel.

00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:32.332
Do you know if it's
linked to anything...

00:33:32.499 --> 00:33:34.374
strange, shady?

00:33:34.957 --> 00:33:36.082
Shady as in what?

00:33:37.707 --> 00:33:38.707
Prostitution.

00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:43.040
It's a luxury hotel.
It must be full of whoremongers.

00:33:43.207 --> 00:33:44.623
Right.

00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:46.790
Why the sudden interest?

00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:49.124
No reason.

00:34:21.457 --> 00:34:22.957
Hello?

00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.957
Hello.

00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:30.457
Hello.

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:36.499
Sara came to see me.
Thank you.

00:34:38.957 --> 00:34:40.873
What do you want?

00:34:41.874 --> 00:34:43.290
I need to talk to her,

00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:45.040
but she isn't in here.

00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:48.166
Sara isn't like the others.

00:34:50.041 --> 00:34:52.291
Only certain clients get to see her.

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.623
I'm not leaving until I speak to her.

00:34:54.957 --> 00:34:57.040
You don't know what you're saying.

00:35:07.207 --> 00:35:11.207
In the lobby, next to the bathrooms,
is a door leading down to the kitchens.

00:35:11.374 --> 00:35:14.332
Go in and wait in the hallway.

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.041
What are you doing?

00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:17.791
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:36:21.624 --> 00:36:22.790
You left this.

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.165
I left it because I didn't want it.

00:36:26.957 --> 00:36:29.873
I can help you find out what
happened to your daughter.

00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:31.624
My daughter died.

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.791
You don't want to know...?

00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:42.291
I don't need you to do this.

00:36:45.291 --> 00:36:46.832
Thank you.

00:36:51.707 --> 00:36:54.332
-Who are you?
-He's a client.

00:36:54.499 --> 00:36:56.915
I'm talking to the lady,
it's fine.

00:36:57.082 --> 00:36:59.582
-Let's talk outside.
-Don't touch me.

00:36:59.749 --> 00:37:01.665
-Don't touch me.
-Tom, let's go.

00:37:01.916 --> 00:37:03.166
Eh, eh!

00:37:05.832 --> 00:37:07.207
Is he...?

00:37:07.374 --> 00:37:09.207
Do you get rid of the babies?

00:37:10.624 --> 00:37:12.165
-Why'd he say that?
-I'm talking to you.

00:37:12.332 --> 00:37:13.082
No...

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:15.165
You can't be here.

00:37:16.832 --> 00:37:18.665
I can help you, Sara.

00:37:27.624 --> 00:37:29.249
No, no, no...

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:30.332
Let's go.

00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:32.373
Let's go.
Tom, please.

00:37:36.082 --> 00:37:37.290
Fuck!

00:37:56.332 --> 00:37:57.582
Tom.

00:37:58.957 --> 00:38:00.332
I'm sorry.

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:15.416
Let's go! Run!

00:38:23.124 --> 00:38:24.457
-Is that your car?
-Yes.

00:38:24.624 --> 00:38:25.665
Go.

00:38:25.832 --> 00:38:27.998
-Sara, I can't drive.
-I don't know how.

00:38:28.166 --> 00:38:29.916
Help me, please.

00:38:30.832 --> 00:38:31.957
Sara!

00:38:35.249 --> 00:38:36.207
Let's go!

00:38:37.499 --> 00:38:38.874
Sara, come here!

00:38:39.374 --> 00:38:42.249
Take the gearstick.
Left, then forward.

00:38:42.416 --> 00:38:43.582
That's it.

00:38:49.624 --> 00:38:51.374
Take it easy.

00:38:55.082 --> 00:38:56.623
We have to call the police.

00:38:59.374 --> 00:39:00.665
-Why not?

00:39:01.082 --> 00:39:03.332
Because it'll be worse later.

00:39:03.499 --> 00:39:04.957
Are you sure?

00:39:10.166 --> 00:39:12.166
Then where do we go?

00:39:12.332 --> 00:39:13.957
I don't know.

00:39:58.916 --> 00:40:00.791
How long have you been
with those people?

00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:06.124
Since forever.

00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:11.374
And your daughter...? Why...?

00:40:25.124 --> 00:40:26.790
Do you have a passport?

00:40:29.332 --> 00:40:30.082
No.

00:40:32.124 --> 00:40:33.707
They keep it.

00:40:34.374 --> 00:40:37.082
There are countries you could hide in,
but without a passport...

00:40:37.874 --> 00:40:39.124
I have to go back.

00:40:44.207 --> 00:40:46.623
No. No, no.

00:41:07.249 --> 00:41:08.499
Take whatever you want.

00:41:25.499 --> 00:41:27.415
I'll leave some clean sheets.

00:41:28.332 --> 00:41:30.832
I have to get up early to work,

00:41:30.999 --> 00:41:33.374
but it's very important
that you stay here.

00:41:33.916 --> 00:41:36.332
You can't move, alright?
You can...

00:41:37.582 --> 00:41:40.040
...watch TV, whatever you want.

00:41:40.207 --> 00:41:41.832
There's food in the fridge.

00:41:43.374 --> 00:41:46.207
And when you go to bed,
lock the door, please.

00:43:04.582 --> 00:43:06.915
I checked out your hotel.

00:43:08.874 --> 00:43:11.832
It's a major chain,

00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:14.624
with power full connections.
They're located in

00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:18.041
London, Moscow,
Abu Dhabi, Buenos Aires...

00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:22.457
Nothing here, there hasn't been
an altercation in years, but...

00:43:23.457 --> 00:43:26.248
Some officers from
the district told me that,

00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:29.207
yes, there's high-end prostitution.

00:43:29.374 --> 00:43:31.832
So, exclusive clients,
powerful people.

00:43:31.999 --> 00:43:33.707
If they know,
why don't they do something?

00:43:33.874 --> 00:43:36.499
Mario, prostitution isn't a crime
in this country,

00:43:36.666 --> 00:43:38.082
it's a-legal.

00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.249
A-legal?

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:42.207
The crime is human trafficking...

00:43:42.374 --> 00:43:44.540
and it's very hard to prove.

00:43:44.707 --> 00:43:45.790
Especially if you're afraid

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.790
of catching some minister
in his underpants in a raid.

00:43:48.957 --> 00:43:50.207
Sure.

00:43:51.249 --> 00:43:52.957
Why the big interest in this hotel?

00:43:53.624 --> 00:43:54.999
Is it about that baby?

00:43:57.541 --> 00:43:58.707
I'm taking this inside.

00:44:01.457 --> 00:44:02.540
Hey, dinner's on you this Friday.

00:44:03.082 --> 00:44:04.790
I can't do it on Friday.

00:44:06.957 --> 00:44:09.123
-You can't?
-No, I've got a lot of work.

00:44:09.916 --> 00:44:12.916
Sure, you have to turn Spain around
all by yourself.

00:44:14.332 --> 00:44:16.623
Can you at least give me the stamp?

00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:17.957
Yes.

00:44:45.457 --> 00:44:47.790
Well, thanks a lot.

00:44:48.582 --> 00:44:50.082
See you later.

00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:07.957
What happened?

00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:09.832
Nothing.

00:45:10.124 --> 00:45:12.540
I wondered if you'd let me
spruce it up a little.

00:45:13.832 --> 00:45:15.957
I told you to stay inside,

00:45:16.624 --> 00:45:18.540
to not come out,
that it was dangerous.

00:45:22.541 --> 00:45:24.041
They're going to find me anyway.

00:45:25.457 --> 00:45:27.040
It's a matter of time.

00:46:35.207 --> 00:46:36.540
What is this place?

00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:42.499
My house.

00:47:27.457 --> 00:47:29.623
What a pretty wail.

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:33.665
You're going to be a mezzo-soprano.

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:43.541
Tell them to have it all ready
in two hours.

00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:57.499
Sir! Sir!

00:48:00.166 --> 00:48:01.999
Thank you, Marcelito.

00:48:03.957 --> 00:48:06.873
-Hello?
-Something happened.

00:48:07.791 --> 00:48:11.499
What happened? Spit it out.

00:48:23.416 --> 00:48:25.416
Got a cigarette?

00:48:36.874 --> 00:48:38.499
It's going to get ugly.

00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:48.582
He called me to the room.
I didn't tell him anything.

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:56.665
What'll happen now?

00:48:59.749 --> 00:49:01.624
He's coming here.

00:49:07.166 --> 00:49:08.249
When?

00:49:09.332 --> 00:49:10.707
Soon.

00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:20.457
Hello.

00:50:21.207 --> 00:50:22.498
Hello.

00:50:38.957 --> 00:50:41.207
The power will come on tomorrow.

00:50:45.791 --> 00:50:47.832
I got you a phone.

00:50:51.124 --> 00:50:53.374
It's a burner,
only I have the number.

00:50:57.457 --> 00:50:59.207
I brought you a passport too.

00:51:03.916 --> 00:51:06.791
To go to your country.
Act like you're a tourist.

00:51:08.957 --> 00:51:09.873
No.

00:51:11.499 --> 00:51:15.207
-Keep it. I have nowhere to go.
-I can't hide you here forever.

00:51:16.332 --> 00:51:18.207
I know.

00:51:25.207 --> 00:51:27.165
Why don't you tell me
something about yourself?

00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:56.374
-Sara!
-No!

00:52:57.082 --> 00:52:58.040
Sara!

00:52:59.332 --> 00:53:00.290
Sara!

00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:02.832
Stop! Where are you going?

00:53:03.957 --> 00:53:05.957
Sara, are you alright?
Are you alright?

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.624
-Leave me alone!
-No!

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:10.957
-I have to get back!
-No! Why are you running away?

00:53:11.124 --> 00:53:12.332
-They'll kill you!
-No!

00:53:12.499 --> 00:53:13.874
They'll kill you because of me!

00:53:14.041 --> 00:53:15.874
No, I'll be alright! Come on!

00:53:18.332 --> 00:53:19.623
Go inside.

00:53:26.249 --> 00:53:27.540
Let me out.

00:53:27.707 --> 00:53:29.082
-Let me go!
-No.

00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:32.332
-Let me out!
-No! No!

00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:34.666
Let me out!

00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:38.499
You can't do anything.

00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:40.332
-Yes, I can.
-You can't.

00:53:40.499 --> 00:53:41.707
-You can't!
-Yes, I can.

00:53:41.874 --> 00:53:44.124
You can't do anything for me!
You can't!

00:53:44.291 --> 00:53:45.874
I can!

00:53:48.082 --> 00:53:49.790
I can fix it!

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:52.457
I can! Understand?

00:53:53.582 --> 00:53:56.373
I can! I can!

00:53:58.207 --> 00:53:59.665
I can!

00:54:25.457 --> 00:54:28.373
I just wanted my girl
to have a normal life.

00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:33.791
That's why I thought
it was good to hand her over.

00:54:34.874 --> 00:54:37.999
When a girl got pregnant,

00:54:38.166 --> 00:54:40.832
she knew she had to
hand over the child.

00:54:42.499 --> 00:54:44.332
Did you never try to run away?

00:54:49.332 --> 00:54:51.040
Once.

00:54:52.332 --> 00:54:53.915
Never again.

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.957
I want to help you,
but I don't know how.

00:55:13.207 --> 00:55:15.290
Don't lock me inside again.

00:55:15.874 --> 00:55:17.249
Not you.

00:55:21.457 --> 00:55:23.332
You can go or you can stay.

00:55:26.166 --> 00:55:27.332
You're free.

00:55:29.457 --> 00:55:30.665
Free.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.916
That's nasty.

00:57:02.082 --> 00:57:03.832
It almost doesn't hurt anymore.

00:57:05.082 --> 00:57:07.748
We old folks live with pain.

00:57:07.916 --> 00:57:10.291
We're used to it.

00:57:10.666 --> 00:57:14.207
You young folks have to feel it.

00:57:14.374 --> 00:57:16.957
Pain teaches you.

00:57:19.207 --> 00:57:21.248
Come on, let's go.

00:57:36.499 --> 00:57:37.874
It smells good.

00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:49.457
Do you speak French?

00:57:51.582 --> 00:57:53.540
Yes, a little.

00:57:54.291 --> 00:57:56.957
I lived in Paris
for two years, in a hotel.

00:57:58.749 --> 00:57:59.790
What?

00:58:03.374 --> 00:58:06.499
Nothing, show's nice
when you're on holiday.

00:58:10.374 --> 00:58:11.915
I don't understand.

00:58:12.707 --> 00:58:15.707
I've never been on holiday.

00:58:16.416 --> 00:58:18.374
Vacances. "Holidays"

00:58:19.707 --> 00:58:22.707
So, "Do you want
to go on holiday?"

00:58:22.874 --> 00:58:24.707
Is "Do you want to go
on "vacances?".

00:58:25.291 --> 00:58:26.957
-Vacances.
-"Vacons".

00:58:27.124 --> 00:58:28.624
-Vacances.
-"Vacons".

00:58:30.582 --> 00:58:31.790
Your French sucks.

00:58:39.041 --> 00:58:40.124
And this house?

00:58:40.916 --> 00:58:43.332
You were going to live here
with someone, right?

00:58:47.207 --> 00:58:48.790
It doesn't suit me, does it?

00:58:49.457 --> 00:58:50.415
Well...

00:58:51.291 --> 00:58:54.166
I had another job before,
I had a girlfriend...

00:58:56.457 --> 00:58:58.207
I wanted to get married,
have kids,

00:58:58.374 --> 00:59:01.374
teach them how to ride a bike,
all that stuff.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:05.041
I wanted to surprise her,
I bought her this house.

00:59:08.332 --> 00:59:10.873
And the day that...

00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:14.707
I brought all the moving boxes,

00:59:15.582 --> 00:59:18.457
I sent her the address
and waited for her here.

00:59:19.999 --> 00:59:20.957
With a ring.

00:59:22.249 --> 00:59:25.915
But she was involved with
another guy, from her work.

00:59:26.374 --> 00:59:28.957
She wanted to get married,
but not to me.

00:59:29.124 --> 00:59:31.665
And I never stepped in
this house again.

00:59:32.124 --> 00:59:33.457
Until now.

00:59:34.957 --> 00:59:36.707
With a ring?

00:59:37.749 --> 00:59:40.832
-Hey, it's not funny.
-No. Sorry.

00:59:40.999 --> 00:59:43.124
It's not funny. Not at all.

00:59:44.207 --> 00:59:45.332
With a ring!

00:59:51.999 --> 00:59:53.707
-Like this.
-But I can't...

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.957
-I can't...
-Like this.

00:59:57.957 --> 01:00:01.165
Foot on the clutch,
and put it in second gear.

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:02.540
Now slowly release it.

01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:04.582
Very good.

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:55.665
Hello, Ana.

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:27.374
Here you go.

01:01:28.249 --> 01:01:29.415
Thank you.

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:33.457
Mario told me you're a good friend.

01:01:34.249 --> 01:01:36.790
We've known each other for ages.

01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:39.624
Really? Where did you two meet?

01:01:41.457 --> 01:01:42.457
Here.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:48.707
I took him away, under arrest.

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:52.957
-Why?
-For homicide.

01:01:54.957 --> 01:01:57.290
Homicide? Why...?

01:01:59.874 --> 01:02:03.124
Sara, I don't know
what you know about Mario.

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:07.707
Well, years ago
Mario was with a girl.

01:02:07.874 --> 01:02:09.749
They wanted to have children
but they couldn't.

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:13.541
The relationship was falling apart
but she suddenly got pregnant.

01:02:13.707 --> 01:02:15.207
And he was thrilled to bits.

01:02:15.374 --> 01:02:18.040
But she turned up here with a guy,

01:02:18.207 --> 01:02:19.832
said she was leaving him
for this man

01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:23.749
and to forget about the child.

01:02:24.499 --> 01:02:26.457
Then Mario lost his mind.

01:02:26.916 --> 01:02:28.582
He argued with him,
they got into a scuffle,

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:31.082
and he slammed the man's head
against that column.

01:02:36.499 --> 01:02:38.124
Was it an accident?

01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:41.207
Yes.

01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:45.291
What happened to the child?

01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:49.498
She visited him in prison
and said the child hadn't been born.

01:02:51.499 --> 01:02:52.915
Okay.

01:02:55.582 --> 01:02:58.373
I don't want to set you
against him,

01:02:58.541 --> 01:02:59.874
but I can help you.

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:02.707
I can put you in touch
with people who can...

01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:05.415
offer you protection,
legal advice

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.165
and a place to go.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.916
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:17.165
Here, my card,
in case you change your mind.

01:03:18.207 --> 01:03:19.957
-Okay?
-Thank you.

01:04:02.082 --> 01:04:03.332
Look at me.

01:04:04.749 --> 01:04:06.874
I know you were fond of her,

01:04:08.374 --> 01:04:10.540
but this had to be done right.

01:04:13.874 --> 01:04:18.040
Go on, finish up
and go get a drink.

01:04:19.457 --> 01:04:22.623
We're going to need a substitute.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.666
FOR SALE

01:04:50.457 --> 01:04:52.040
Here it is.

01:04:54.707 --> 01:04:56.207
Well, that's it.

01:05:06.416 --> 01:05:08.249
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

01:05:08.416 --> 01:05:11.582
I was told that here
I can get back something I lost.

01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:13.999
If it was handed in to the police,
or at a station

01:05:14.166 --> 01:05:16.082
airport, or a State building

01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:19.624
and two months have passed
without anyone asking for it,

01:05:19.791 --> 01:05:22.499
it must've been sent here.
What's the item?

01:05:22.749 --> 01:05:24.457
A young lady.

01:05:25.207 --> 01:05:26.790
Very beautiful.

01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:29.541
Her name's Sara.

01:05:34.457 --> 01:05:36.873
This isn't Missing Persons,
that's somewhere else.

01:05:38.332 --> 01:05:39.873
Are you sure?

01:05:43.457 --> 01:05:44.290
Yes.

01:05:47.624 --> 01:05:50.374
It didn't hurt to try.

01:06:18.499 --> 01:06:19.624
Come on. Fuck!

01:06:34.166 --> 01:06:35.249
Sara!

01:06:44.082 --> 01:06:45.207
Sara?

01:08:04.207 --> 01:08:05.540
Hello, Sara.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.207
He's here.

01:08:12.249 --> 01:08:14.124
Help me, please.

01:08:31.791 --> 01:08:33.249
Hello, Sara.

01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:36.916
Are you okay?

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.666
He says that he reached you

01:08:41.832 --> 01:08:44.332
thanks to a lost suitcase
in the river,

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.207
that he's just a government clerk.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.915
Please, don't you hurt her.

01:08:52.374 --> 01:08:53.832
Don't hurt her.

01:08:54.874 --> 01:08:57.207
He also says he loves you.

01:09:02.582 --> 01:09:04.748
Do you love him?

01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:12.624
He's nobody. He knows nothing.

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:15.332
Please.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:26.998
Let's go, Sara.

01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:29.665
-Please.
-Let's go, Sara.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.332
Go on, you're alright. Let's go.

01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:51.457
Stealing is very bad.

01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:54.999
Didn't they teach you that at school?

01:09:56.666 --> 01:09:58.291
I didn't steal anything.

01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:01.832
That's what all thieves say.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:05.791
Sara's a very valuable girl.

01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:11.249
You can't put a price
on a human being.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:13.957
Nevertheless, it's the first thing
in the world

01:10:14.124 --> 01:10:15.999
to be given a price.

01:10:19.624 --> 01:10:22.165
There's always a demand for it...

01:10:22.332 --> 01:10:24.790
and always a supply.

01:10:32.457 --> 01:10:34.082
Leave me alone.

01:11:21.624 --> 01:11:23.165
Look after her.

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:27.832
Please.

01:11:44.874 --> 01:11:46.332
Police!

01:11:48.874 --> 01:11:50.957
Here!

01:11:59.832 --> 01:12:02.748
Fuck! What the fuck, Mario?!

01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:03.916
Mario!

01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:07.290
Mario! Are you alright?
Can you hear me?

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:10.457
I need an ambulance urgently.
88 Castafios.

01:12:10.624 --> 01:12:11.874
Urgently.

01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:15.707
Mario... Mario, look at me!
I'm here with me.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:17.623
Can you see me?

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.582
Mario, can you see me?

01:12:55.916 --> 01:12:58.749
Hey there.
How are you today?

01:13:00.957 --> 01:13:02.082
Fine.

01:13:02.249 --> 01:13:03.457
Fine, great.

01:13:03.624 --> 01:13:04.790
I'm glad.

01:13:06.499 --> 01:13:08.790
So, what are you going to do?

01:13:10.249 --> 01:13:11.874
Are you going to report it or not?

01:13:12.957 --> 01:13:14.998
No, they were only burglars.

01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:18.457
Burglars who didn't steal anything.

01:13:18.624 --> 01:13:20.582
There was nothing to steal, Helena.

01:13:20.749 --> 01:13:21.957
Fuck, Mario.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:25.457
What did you want?

01:13:26.624 --> 01:13:29.832
-I wanted to save her.
-Sure, you wanted to save her.

01:13:30.749 --> 01:13:34.665
Is that what you liked,
that she needed you?

01:13:43.207 --> 01:13:44.248
Mario.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:47.582
I'm poison.

01:13:49.541 --> 01:13:51.207
A poison that kills
everything it touches.

01:13:51.374 --> 01:13:53.582
Mario, come on.

01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:57.499
Don't be an asshole.

01:14:49.874 --> 01:14:52.290
LOST & FOUND

01:14:52.457 --> 01:14:55.123
The next lot is number 46.

01:14:55.749 --> 01:14:58.082
You can find all the details
in the brochure, page 11,

01:14:58.249 --> 01:15:00.707
lot 208.

01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:01.707
PUBLIC AUCTION

01:15:01.874 --> 01:15:03.624
The asking price is 3000 euros.

01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:06.873
3000 euros for number 12.
Thank you.

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:08.791
Any more bids?

01:15:08.957 --> 01:15:11.873
Sold to 309 for 3,300 euros.

01:15:12.124 --> 01:15:15.665
The next lot consists of 223 pieces.

01:15:15.832 --> 01:15:19.415
Cameras, lenses
and photographic accessories.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:21.915
We've done half a dozen auctions.

01:15:22.249 --> 01:15:24.457
How long have you two
been here on your own?

01:15:26.082 --> 01:15:27.207
Seven years.

01:15:27.374 --> 01:15:29.499
Feels longer to me.

01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:31.416
They never sent anyone else?

01:15:32.957 --> 01:15:35.832
They decided we got by just fine.
Right, Andrés?

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:37.790
-Yes.
-Andres brought me up to speed.

01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:39.123
More or less.

01:15:39.957 --> 01:15:41.040
Listen, guys,

01:15:41.916 --> 01:15:44.332
you've done a good job
all this time,

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.540
but this isn't a hotel,
you can't live here.

01:15:49.999 --> 01:15:52.582
-Andrés retires in two months.
-And three days.

01:15:52.749 --> 01:15:54.415
We'll look for a replacement.

01:15:55.624 --> 01:15:58.749
As of today, you have to clock in.

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:02.499
And you'll be under my supervision.

01:16:13.957 --> 01:16:15.415
Look what just turned up.

01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:19.582
You got lucky.

01:16:21.457 --> 01:16:23.957
Normally to find something you lost,

01:16:24.332 --> 01:16:26.248
first you have to look for it.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:28.290
Obviously.

01:16:44.624 --> 01:16:46.040
I wanted to say sorry.

01:16:48.416 --> 01:16:50.332
-Come on, Mario.
-Just let me talk.

01:16:50.499 --> 01:16:52.374
-You don't have to...
- I'm really sorry.

01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:58.707
I'm sorry I haven't been
what you expected me to be.

01:17:00.624 --> 01:17:04.499
I'm sorry I haven't been
what you needed.

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:20.041
I came for another reason.

01:17:24.207 --> 01:17:26.873
That day, Sara went to
the drugstore and bought this.

01:17:27.207 --> 01:17:29.457
I suppose she had
no time to use it.

01:17:29.624 --> 01:17:31.707
I found it at the entrance
to your house.

01:18:25.166 --> 01:18:26.166
No.

01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:30.207
Please.
Get out or I'll call the police!

01:18:30.374 --> 01:18:33.165
Call them. We'll tell them
where your daughter came from.

01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:34.748
-Please.
-Mom?

01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:36.999
Rebeca...

01:18:38.707 --> 01:18:40.290
Rebecca, go to your room.

01:18:42.582 --> 01:18:44.207
I have to speak to this man.

01:18:46.832 --> 01:18:49.582
My husband took a trip
and came back with our girl.

01:18:49.874 --> 01:18:51.749
I didn't ask any questions,
I didn't want to know.

01:18:53.207 --> 01:18:56.582
He wanted to give Rebecca a sister.
He knew he hadn't long to live.

01:18:58.874 --> 01:19:02.249
I did the same trip
and they gave me a baby,

01:19:04.082 --> 01:19:05.540
she was premature.

01:19:07.832 --> 01:19:10.123
But on the flight home
she hardly moved.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:15.374
When I got here, she was dead.

01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:18.957
And you threw her into the river.

01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:26.749
I need to find that baby's mother,
and you're going to help me.

01:19:29.457 --> 01:19:30.832
Where was that trip to?

01:19:44.082 --> 01:19:48.582
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the flight.

01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:50.791
This is your captain speaking.
My name is Jose Luis Llorente.

01:19:50.957 --> 01:19:54.373
The estimated flying time
is around 13 hours.

01:20:14.457 --> 01:20:16.373
Stuffed tortillas!

01:20:50.582 --> 01:20:52.123
Mr. Armendariz?

01:20:56.332 --> 01:20:57.415
Shall we walk?

01:20:58.624 --> 01:20:59.665
Can you?

01:21:00.374 --> 01:21:01.374
Yes.

01:21:03.541 --> 01:21:05.832
So you know Mrs. Valenzuela.

01:21:06.874 --> 01:21:08.457
Her husband, really, Raul.

01:21:09.249 --> 01:21:11.374
I'm so sorry for her loss.

01:21:11.999 --> 01:21:13.790
Were you very close?

01:21:15.707 --> 01:21:17.540
Yes, yes.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.582
I want to be a father now.

01:21:22.041 --> 01:21:24.041
For single men, it's complicated.

01:21:24.207 --> 01:21:26.957
Adoption is very hard.
I've tried everything.

01:21:27.124 --> 01:21:29.915
Sure, it's incredible that

01:21:30.499 --> 01:21:33.040
there are so many
abandoned children in the world

01:21:33.207 --> 01:21:36.540
when there are people who can
love them, give them a better life.

01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:40.041
A child is always a blessing.

01:21:41.082 --> 01:21:42.832
I suppose you'll want

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:45.499
a surrogate pregnancy.

01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:47.874
-That takes time.
-And money.

01:21:48.416 --> 01:21:50.332
Money's... not a problem.

01:21:50.624 --> 01:21:52.624
Listen, I want a baby,
I want it now.

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:56.499
With all the paperwork in place.
I won't ask any questions.

01:22:02.957 --> 01:22:04.790
It has to be in cash.

01:22:09.249 --> 01:22:11.707
-You're at the Hotel Principal?
-Yes.

01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:13.999
It'll take a few days.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:17.874
I'll wait for your call, then?

01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:19.916
I'll contact you.

01:22:22.916 --> 01:22:24.457
Have the money ready.

01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:09.916
PAWN SHOP

01:24:25.874 --> 01:24:27.207
Hello?

01:24:27.374 --> 01:24:30.165
Take the money to the local bank
first thing tomorrow,

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:31.957
then wait outside.

01:25:47.291 --> 01:25:48.582
Good morning.

01:25:48.749 --> 01:25:50.165
Welcome.

01:25:52.624 --> 01:25:53.749
May 1?

01:26:12.416 --> 01:26:13.499
Thanks a lot.

01:26:46.207 --> 01:26:49.165
PRIVATE PROPERTY
NO TRESPASSING

01:27:38.916 --> 01:27:40.416
Do I have to choose?

01:27:42.166 --> 01:27:44.332
You'll get all the medical reports,

01:27:45.624 --> 01:27:49.540
but sometimes people
reject the babies.

01:27:53.041 --> 01:27:54.166
Follow me.

01:28:00.499 --> 01:28:03.915
This is the provisional
birth certificate, but it's official.

01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:08.791
You just need to fill in
the names of the baby

01:28:08.957 --> 01:28:11.040
and the parents.

01:28:11.207 --> 01:28:13.373
-It's enough to exit the country.
-Good.

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:18.207
Take your time.

01:28:19.457 --> 01:28:23.373
When you're finished,
hit 0 on the phone.

01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:47.916
VACCINATION BOOK

01:30:41.332 --> 01:30:43.165
You have almost a month to go.

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.165
You're alive!

01:31:45.832 --> 01:31:47.248
Do you know how
to get out of here?

01:31:49.374 --> 01:31:51.124
Are you ready or what?

01:31:51.291 --> 01:31:53.666
-It just needs tightening.
-Then get to it.

01:31:58.916 --> 01:31:59.957
This way.

01:32:11.624 --> 01:32:13.249
She's fucking me over.

01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:16.207
Get in the car! Go!

01:32:30.124 --> 01:32:31.582
Do you want to go on "vacances"?

01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:32.332
Did you really think

01:33:32.499 --> 01:33:34.790
you could just go in and take her?

01:33:35.624 --> 01:33:37.082
I can give you more money.

01:33:37.874 --> 01:33:40.082
Now you're a capitalist?

01:33:42.624 --> 01:33:45.790
I don't think you have
that much money.

01:34:09.416 --> 01:34:10.249
Get out of the way!

01:35:23.166 --> 01:35:25.416
No, no! No.

01:35:31.249 --> 01:35:32.374
He's my brother.

01:35:45.332 --> 01:35:46.373
Go.

01:35:47.332 --> 01:35:48.373
Go!

01:36:00.499 --> 01:36:01.540
You're hurt.

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.207
-I'm fine.

01:36:04.999 --> 01:36:07.040
-No, you're bleeding.
-I'm fine.

01:36:24.249 --> 01:36:25.290
Let's go.

01:36:26.249 --> 01:36:27.457
Let's go!

01:36:50.624 --> 01:36:52.040
-You have to stop!
-Hang in there.

01:36:52.207 --> 01:36:56.082
-You have to help me!
-I can't right now!

01:37:18.207 --> 01:37:19.623
I don't want him to die.

01:37:23.332 --> 01:37:24.748
He's not going to die.

01:37:37.582 --> 01:37:38.790
Hello, my love.

01:37:43.249 --> 01:37:44.415
We have to go.

01:37:46.124 --> 01:37:47.249
And your wound?

01:37:47.707 --> 01:37:50.207
It's not serious,
the bullet went clean through.

01:37:50.874 --> 01:37:52.540
Rest for a few minutes.

01:37:54.416 --> 01:37:55.457
No.

01:39:15.332 --> 01:39:17.457
I don't know how
to calm him down.

01:39:20.916 --> 01:39:22.249
Give him to me.

01:39:30.416 --> 01:39:32.582
It's alright.

01:39:58.416 --> 01:40:00.874
Go! Let's see
who gets there first.

01:40:01.124 --> 01:40:03.290
Let's see who gets there first. Go!

01:40:06.249 --> 01:40:07.665
I was faster.

01:40:11.874 --> 01:40:13.082
Go. Let's go!

01:40:17.791 --> 01:40:18.999
Good!

01:40:42.374 --> 01:40:44.790
Hi, my love!

01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:47.666
We're here.

01:40:47.874 --> 01:40:48.874
Mario.

01:40:50.957 --> 01:40:51.998
My love.

01:40:54.457 --> 01:40:55.498
My love.

01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:08.207
No!

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:13.666
My love!

01:41:47.749 --> 01:41:49.082
Welcome to Montreal.

01:41:52.832 --> 01:41:53.915
Welcome.

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:13.124
BIRTH

01:42:20.791 --> 01:42:22.207
Take off your glasses, please.

01:42:34.666 --> 01:42:35.332
Welcome.

01:42:36.874 --> 01:42:37.957
Thank you.

01:43:05.582 --> 01:43:07.540
First time in Montreal?

01:43:09.499 --> 01:43:10.499
Yes.

01:43:11.916 --> 01:43:13.749
Holiday?

01:43:16.666 --> 01:43:17.791
Yes.

01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:20.291
I'm on holiday.

01:43:22.207 --> 01:43:23.582
Enjoy your stay.
