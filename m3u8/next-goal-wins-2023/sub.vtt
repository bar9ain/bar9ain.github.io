WEBVTT

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.354
Oh, hello, there!

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:04.607
Didn't see you creeping up
behind me.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:08.903
Welcome. Come on, come in here
and listen

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.739
to this wonderful tale of woe.

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:14.700
Not woe as in,
"Ah, bummer, man!"

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.912
But woe as in,
"Whoa! That's amazing!

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.414
"I can't believe that pretty
much actually happened!

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:21.665
"With a couple
of embellishments

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:22.750
"along the way."

00:01:23.334 --> 00:01:26.212
Our tale is a tale
of two islands.

00:01:26.378 --> 00:01:28.506
One is a teeny-weeny
beautiful,

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:30.841
little tropical island
in the Pacific Ocean

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.093
called American Samoa.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.180
Home to a wonderful people,
who are deeply religious,

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:40.017
hardworking and deeply religious.

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.479
But the other island,
that was a man.

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.940
The Palagi white man!

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.025
And just like
any incredible story,

00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:52.571
our tale begins
with utter humiliation.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.491
Well, here
they come. American Samoa.

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.245
A bit of smiling going on,
but some apprehension as well.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:02.998
Well, that's the first one.

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.170
Goal!
It's three.

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:12.049
They scored again.
Five for the Socceroos.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.469
Goodness me. Humiliation.
Boys against men.

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.973
Oh dear, oh dear.
Hard to keep count.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.559
It's getting embarrassing.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.103
Goal. Goal. Goal.

00:02:25.563 --> 00:02:27.273
Just too easy. Goal.

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:33.237
Thirty-one. American Samoa

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.447
on the wrong end
of the biggest

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:38.117
World Cup hammering ever.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:49.003
And 10 years later,
they were just as bad.

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.172
In fact, I think they had
actually gotten worse.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.719
Come on!

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.101
American Samoa!

00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:28.918
Samoa!
Samoa!

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.506
You guys suck!

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.926

Oh, we're going to lose.

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:47.978
Okay, we can do it.
Come on.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.189
We're going already!

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:52.983
What are you doing?
Goal!

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.777
Oh, my gloves
weren't even on yet.

00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:56.028
- Pisa, put your gloves on.
- I'm not even ready!

00:03:56.362 --> 00:03:57.363
Come on!

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:02.159
- Help, help, help!

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:03.327
Goal!

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:06.288
Move out. Move out.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.334
Goal!

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:12.711
- Goal!

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:18.425
That was
a terrible first half.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.719
And now I'm forced
to give you a growling.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.554
Are you ready
for the growling? Hmm?

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.599
Yes.
Okay, you asked for it.

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:27.101
Get ready.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.105
You were bad. You are bad.

00:04:31.313 --> 00:04:32.731
That was bad.

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.567
Where's the heart?
Where's the spirit?

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:37.945
You have to play
with heart and spirit.

00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:40.197
You're bad. Bad!

00:04:40.364 --> 00:04:42.074
Okay, Ace,
I'll take over from here.

00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.784
Yeah, I think that's best, yeah.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:47.454
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.623
In case you don't know me,
I'm Tavita Taumua.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.875
I'm the President
of the Football Federation

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.210
of American Samoa.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.504
But I think you all
do know me.

00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.381
- Hi, son.
- Hey, Dad.

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.008
I'm here
to beg something

00:04:59.091 --> 00:05:00.217
from you for the second half.

00:05:00.384 --> 00:05:03.429
I know we've never ever
scored a goal, ever!

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.306
But we have to
because I've made a bet

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.100
with the heads
of the football federations

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.184
from the other islands

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.644
that we could.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:12.271
And if we don't,

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:15.482
they're going to draw
a lady boobs on my face.

00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:17.860
That's some
pretty powerful motivation.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.403
Both teams,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:22.489
- please return to the field.
- Okay! 45 minutes left!

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:24.658
Let's go, American Samoa!

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.000
One heart!

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:40.674
Hey, guys,
heads up.

00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.259
Not all of the goals went in.

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:44.720
So, that's heart and spirit.
Right, Tavita?

00:05:46.555 --> 00:05:49.683
Ace, you're a lovely guy,
but you're a terrible coach.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.851
You're sacked.

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:53.645
Okay, cool. That seems fair.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.440
Yeah, take a look.

00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:58.108
Count the boobs.

00:05:58.275 --> 00:05:59.276
Count them.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.528
Individual boobs or pairs?

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.323
I'll save you the trouble.
There's 11 pairs.

00:06:05.074 --> 00:06:06.325
- Eleven pairs.

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:09.119
They drew these
with permanent marker.

00:06:09.286 --> 00:06:10.788
You know what permanent means?

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.081
Forever!

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.874
Aren't you guys sick
of losing?

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:16.043
We haven't scored one goal
in the history

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.587
of our country trying
to have a soccer team.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:20.756
Doesn't that strike you
as odd?

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.674
Mark my words,

00:06:23.092 --> 00:06:25.385
things are going to change.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.721
I'm going to get us
a new coach.

00:06:27.805 --> 00:06:29.306
Huh?

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.390
New coach.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:36.230
Where am I going
to find a new coach?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.065
You have to look off island.

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:39.483
No, that's treason.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.235
Treason is sending
that poor team

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.112
to play games they have
no hope of winning.

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:45.864
You have to think
outside the box.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.492
Hmm, well, sometimes the box

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:50.744
is too small
to think inside of.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:51.912
Maybe I will do it.

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.038
I've already done it.

00:06:53.205 --> 00:06:55.791
I've rung the American
Football Federation

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.334
to put an ad up for the job.

00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:00.003
Dad, we don't need some Palagi
with his white savior complex

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.547
to come teach us
how to play soccer.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.631
Daru!

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.424
But there's so many other
great coaches on the island.

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:06.009
- Like who?
- Like Ace.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:07.177
I sacked him.

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.179
He's no good with pressure.
He hates pressure.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:10.722
You hate pressure,
don't you, Ace?

00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.350
Yeah, that's true. I hate it.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.519
There's only four weeks to the
World Cup qualifier, Dad.

00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:17.312
We should just get a coach
from the island.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.064
- Don't make me

00:07:19.148 --> 00:07:21.275
- hit you with this sandal.

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:24.319
We are getting a real coach.
That's it!

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.029
And don't think
I haven't noticed

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.656
those big boobs on your face.

00:07:27.823 --> 00:07:29.032
Whose boobs are those?

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.576
I don't know,
they're drawings.

00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:32.411
Drawings of boobs
are a gateway

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:33.620
to the real thing.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.372
Be careful, my mister.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.294
Look,
I know this season

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:42.713
didn't go as planned.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.673
It's known
as the beautiful game,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.759
but let's face it,
it's a complicated game, guys.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.804
Football, soccer,
as you like to call it,

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:54.474
is like life. You know?

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:58.020
You're riding high in April
and shot down in May.

00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:01.982
Um, next season, I think,
we have a real shot.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:04.568
As long as you, uh, trust me
and allow me

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:06.528
to play the system
that I like to play.

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:11.533
Uh, I'm sorry, uh,
Thomas, did nobody tell you?

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.870
You're... You're fired.

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:16.914
Did honestly nobody tell you?

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.373
- Rhys, did you not...
Yeah, of course, I...

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.293
I'm fired? Are you joking?
Are you kidding me?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.254
Obviously, you're in shock,
which is understandable.

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.048
And it is only natural
that you go through

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.674
the five stages of grief,

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.092
which Rhys, I think,
you have a...

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.054
Yes. Thank you, Alex.
We'll just quickly run this...

00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:36.183
Thank you, Chris. There we go.
Yep, too far. Release it.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.143
Now, to... You've lost it.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.271
Settle it there.
Just, yep, there we go.

00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:44.566
Thanks, Chris. Spin it round.

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:47.694
- No, you got to flip it.
Flip the...

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.155
Yep, there we go.
And spin it round.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.493
Stage one, denial.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.702
This is not happening.

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.829
There it is. That's it,
that's classic denial.

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.624
Good news is,
you got two options. Rhys?

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.127
Option one, that's where
you're currently at.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.171
Or...
Chris?

00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:10.759
Pacific Ocean?

00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:14.930
Uh, well, yes. Uh, but, no.
Specifically, American Samoa.

00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:16.473
American Samoa?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.184
Are you serious?
Is this a joke?

00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:20.269
Gail, do you know about this?

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:23.188
Yes, it was my idea.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.274
Can't believe
you'd do this to me!

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.486
- I deserve some respect.
- Oh, boy.

00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:31.196
I'm the only one in this room

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.906
that knows anything
about this game.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:36.368
Stage two. Anger.

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:37.828
That anger is real.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.413
Was he this angry
when you were married?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:41.623
He was calmer before.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.667
Thomas, you need to stop
thinking about this

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.751
as some kind of punishment.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.421
This could be
a chance to heal.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:49.840
Maybe find a new direction.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:51.967
Oh, Gail!

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.386
God, I love that, Gail.
That is so good. Excellent.

00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:57.222
I played this game
at the top level.

00:09:58.015 --> 00:09:59.558
This isn't fair.

00:09:59.725 --> 00:10:00.851
Fair?

00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:02.561
You want to know about fair?

00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:04.187
Oh, here we go.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:05.731
Let me tell you
a story, buddy.

00:10:05.814 --> 00:10:08.233
When I was
a kid, I had this dog.

00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.193
And I loved this dog.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.737
But then, he got older.

00:10:11.903 --> 00:10:13.447
And I guess he had
some anger issues.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:15.073
Wasn't the same dog.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.242
My dad said that we needed
to put the dog down.

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:18.452
So, we take him outside,

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.078
and this dog,
he is whimpering.

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.956
We're taking him out.
"Oh, no, this isn't fair.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.250
"Remember how good
I was in the past?"

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.253
And my dad made me
take that dog outside

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.922
- and drown him in the pond.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.300
I'm the dog in this story?

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.260
No, of course not.
I'm just telling you the story

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:36.345
about my dog
when I was growing up.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.555
And the fact that my dad
was a bit of an asshole.

00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:40.891
Okay, look.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:42.559
I can change.

00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:43.810
I'm flexible, guys.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.896
Let's not make
any rash decisions here.

00:10:46.188 --> 00:10:47.981
Really,
really good stuff, Thomas.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:49.232
You are smoking through these.

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:51.068
There's only two left.
Oh, that's great.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:52.778
- 'Cause I got to...

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:55.697
- Wow.
- Chris?

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:57.908
We only got one left.

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.035
And it's my favorite one
of all.

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:58.844
Mr. Rongen? Mr. Rongen,
hello, Mr. Rongen.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:00.470
Welcome to American Samoa.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.888
What is this shit?

00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:03.890
No naughty words,
pretty please.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.809
This is Who's On The Plane?

00:12:06.017 --> 00:12:08.228
American Samoa's
top-rated show.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:11.231
We interview people who travel
to the island on the plane.

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:13.942
Well, I guess what everyone
at home wants to know is

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.236
why have you come
halfway across the world

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.572
to coach the worst soccer team
in the world?

00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:23.869
I have a very particular
set of skills.

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.164
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.416
Skills that make me
a nightmare

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.084
for people like you.

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.379
I've come here to impasse

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.214
my knowledge
and unique insight

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:39.551
into the beautiful game
and turn this team around.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.136
I'm not God,

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:42.929
but I may as well be.

00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:45.682
Because I perform
more miracles than him.

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:50.187
Okay, well,
one thing's for sure.

00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:53.148
The new coach
is very friendly and outgoing.

00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:55.150
We'll see you next time
for another edition

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:57.110
of Who's On The Plane?

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.237
Mr. Thomas Rongen!

00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:01.448
It's very nice
to meet you.

00:13:01.615 --> 00:13:03.325
I am Tavita, I'm the President

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.827
of the Football Federation
of American Samoa.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.288
And also the cameraman
for Who's On The Plane?

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.832
It's a small island.
We all have lots of jobs.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:12.417
Now, as an honored guest,

00:13:12.501 --> 00:13:13.835
we have a very special
surprise

00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:15.337
waiting outside. Okay?

00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:16.796
So, Gus will look after you.

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.465
Yeah, you'll love this.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:22.260
This is so exciting!
Guys! Guys!

00:13:22.427 --> 00:13:23.970
Dad, why are we here?

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.890
It's all part of my exciting
master surprise plan.

00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:30.018
Gentlemen, I am proud
to officially announce

00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.978
our new official
national coach

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:34.064
of the American Samoa
soccer team.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.986
He's played with some of
the top players in the world.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.196
Oh.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.574
And, he's originally
from Europe.

00:13:44.658 --> 00:13:46.034
Oh.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:50.288
So, let's give him a warm
American Samoan welcome!

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:52.666
Um, okay, guys, hey...

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:11.851
Your chariot awaits.

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:19.109
Okay, okay.

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:21.736
Yeah, great stuff, guys.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:23.405
I think he feels
really welcome.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.823
We'll see you at training.

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:25.907
Hey. Dad,

00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:27.701
how many offshore people
applied for the job?

00:14:27.909 --> 00:14:29.536
Oh, the response
was incredible!

00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:31.121
Yeah? How many
people responded?

00:14:31.288 --> 00:14:32.581
Well, there was him.

00:14:33.123 --> 00:14:34.332
Yeah, it was just him.

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:36.459
But the fact
that he responded,

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:38.169
absolutely incredible.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:39.379
I really think things

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.131
are gonna turn around.
You know, son?

00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:42.799
It's like in The Matrix.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:46.052
I think this man is the Neo.

00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:54.102
Welcome
to American Samoa.

00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:58.315
With a population
of 57,534 people,

00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:01.318
American Samoa is a United
States territory

00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:05.071
like Puerto Rico, but much
smaller and further away.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:09.034
The two main exports
are NFL players and tuna.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.785
It should not be confused

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.121
with the independent nation
of Samoa

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:15.415
with their cocky,
stuck-up people

00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:18.585
always bragging about
their 24-hour McDonald's.

00:15:18.752 --> 00:15:20.503
- Even though we are both Samoan...
- Hey.

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:21.880
...there are two Samoas.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:23.465
Can you drive faster?

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.467
Oh, I would never break
the speed limit.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:28.345
It's 20 miles per hour
across the whole island.

00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:30.096
Interesting fact. The bird

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.390
on the flag
of American Samoa...

00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:37.228
Welcome to your new
accommodation.

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:39.606
Oh, that's your car,

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.192
so you can move
around the island at will.

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:44.694
Mmm-hmm.

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:47.947
And now,
the pièce de résidence.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.538
Your castle awaits.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.416
Your landlord is Sione.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.834
He lives in the house
next door.

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.878
And he is available
seven-twenty-four

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:03.630
to address your every need.

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:05.215
Seven-twenty-four?

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.008
Seven days out
of every twenty-four.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.512
Well, I'll let you
get settled in.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:13.515
And I will leave this Welcome
to American Samoa video here

00:16:13.682 --> 00:16:16.184
for you to peruse
at your leisure.

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:19.187
The qualifiers are only
four weeks away, Mr. Rongen.

00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.565
All I want from our team
is just one goal.

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.150
One goal.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:28.697
One goal.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.721
Hello?

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.892
Hello? Can I use the phone?

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.458
Rongen won the MLS

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:22.709
Coach of the Year award

00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:24.961
and coached the US men's
national team.

00:17:25.128 --> 00:17:27.046
But his career
went mysteriously

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.882
off the rails two years ago.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.593
And I think the question
we're all wondering is...

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.720
Why have you come halfway
across the world

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.848
to coach the worst soccer team
in the world?

00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:41.853
Coach Rongen has

00:17:41.936 --> 00:17:43.354
- a colorful reputation.
- What, what, what, what?

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.858
But the team is hopeful
he can save them

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:49.110
from another
international humiliation.

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:52.030
We caught up with him
as he got off the plane.

00:17:52.238 --> 00:17:53.656
Welcome to American Samoa.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.741
What is this ?

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:58.161
Oh, you're from TV.
Famous guy.

00:17:58.495 --> 00:18:00.121
Welcome
to the convenience store.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.915
I see you found
our conveniently

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:04.167
located libation station.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.920
And conveniently, we're
the local movie rental place.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.880
And the convenient
dreamcatcher outlet.

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.800
You guys have a public phone
that I could use?

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:14.177
Hello?

00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:15.845
Excuse me?

00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:17.347
Hello?

00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.644
What the...

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.702
Now, we gonna do
the Hollywood.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:41.830
Ah, and that's where
you grab your leg.

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:45.250
Ah, and it's really sore,
and you fall down. Hollywood.

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.668
Arnold!

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.339
Get up! Up, up, up!

00:18:51.506 --> 00:18:53.925
Oh, nice. Now, we're gonna
practice pointing and blaming

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.261
where you point to someone
and just blame them.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:57.762
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.977
Ah. Mr. Rongen.

00:19:07.647 --> 00:19:09.065
Nice, little buddy. Okay.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:11.901
Go into the shop, get me
that bottle we talked about.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.528
Off you go.
Thanks, little buddy.

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.280
Run!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.073
Well, gentlemen.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:19.951
I've been watching you.

00:19:20.118 --> 00:19:22.537
And it's safe to say,
you're useless.

00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:27.041
You have zero talent, skill
or understanding of the game.

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:32.005
That is why we're gonna work
on two very simple things.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.340
Fitness and discipline.

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.718
Cacio and the pepe.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:37.927
Cheese and pepper.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.306
Simple dish
but when made well, exquisite.

00:19:41.472 --> 00:19:42.724
So, this is what
we're gonna do.

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:45.476
We're gonna get into two lines
and we're gonna do sprints.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:47.312
Down to the goal and back.

00:19:48.146 --> 00:19:49.397
Two lines! Suicides!

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:52.734
Cheese and pepper!
Come on, let's go! Go!

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.110
Why are we doing this?

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.029
Because I want to see
what you're made of.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.156
You're all a bunch
of Daniel-sans.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.699
And I'm Mr. Miyagi.

00:19:59.866 --> 00:20:02.410
I want to see how many of you
can make the full 90 minutes.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.787
Let's go! Cacio pepe!

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:16.299
- Oh, Jaiyah.
- Hi!

00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:18.676
Hi, boys.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:21.095
Hey, hey, guys!
What's going on?

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:23.222
What were we just
talking about? Discipline.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:25.642
All right. 200 sit-ups down
at the goal.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.060
- Go!

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.228
Go, go, 200!

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:30.980
Hey, coach,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.732
Oh. Ah, ah.

00:20:33.316 --> 00:20:34.692
I just came in from Hawaii.

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:36.819
I'm in middle of, uh, talking
to the squad right now.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:37.904
So, uh...

00:20:38.112 --> 00:20:39.614
You must be team masseuse.

00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.157
Why don't you, uh,
set up in the...

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.450
Oh. No, no, no.
I'm not the team masseuse.

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:44.118
I'm one of the players.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.996
Oh, no, I don't know
where the women's team train,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.081
but it isn't here.

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.000
Oh, no, no, no.
Jaiyah's placed in the team.

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:52.460
This team.

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:54.629
She's a woman.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.798
Well,  not yet.

00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:58.883
What the hell's going on? Ace?

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.551
That's Jaiyah.

00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:02.595
She's our center forward.
Jaiyah.

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:07.934
Okay. Good one.

00:21:08.101 --> 00:21:09.519
Humor. I get it.

00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:12.355
Sure, Jaiyah, go ahead.
Join the squad over there.

00:21:12.522 --> 00:21:13.898
Thanks so much, coach.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.192
Joke's on you now.
She's playing.

00:21:16.693 --> 00:21:18.152
Very good.

00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.071
Something not right
about this guy.

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:22.615
Well, he is white.

00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.409
No. Something else.

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.120
Let's keep our eye on him.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:29.956
All right, Ace.

00:21:30.415 --> 00:21:31.499
Let's see what
they're made of.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:33.334
Look alive, bitches!

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:35.670
All right, come on. We're up.

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:39.173
Wow, a ball! Mr. Miyagi is
really shaking things up.

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:43.011
Okay, Ace. Run me
through the team. Who we got?

00:21:43.553 --> 00:21:46.305
Okay, uh, that's Smiley.

00:21:46.514 --> 00:21:48.391
He's the D'Angelo of soccer.

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:50.059
Hey, Smiley!

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:52.979
Yeah. Oh! And that's Daru.

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:55.189
He's known as the Bad Boy
of soccer.

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:59.068
He's always sliding in
and getting carded. Very bad.

00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:01.863
Oh, that is Samson.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.364
What? Because of his hair?

00:22:03.531 --> 00:22:04.615
No, Samsung.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:07.994
He's named after the giant
Korean tech company.

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:09.954
His father's name is Sony.

00:22:10.997 --> 00:22:15.168
Oh, and there's Jaiyah,
the Cindy Crawford of soccer.

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:16.919
What's his real name?

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:19.881
- Jaiyah.
- No, registered name.

00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.592
Oh, it's Johnny. But you never
want to call her that.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:24.302
Yeah. She's Fa'afafine.

00:22:24.927 --> 00:22:25.970
What does that mean?

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.764
It's part of our culture.

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:30.349
They're just one of us.
But different.

00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:32.185
But you guys are all cool
with this?

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:33.853
How can I put this?
It's like

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.898
imagine a world
without flowers.

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.817
Well, Fa'afafine are
our flowers.

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.278
Be a pretty dull world
without them.

00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:45.114
- Hmm? They're beautiful.

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.992
And who's that large body
in goal?

00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:49.535
Oh, that's Pisa.

00:22:49.702 --> 00:22:51.662
He's not really a goalkeeper.
He's a midfielder,

00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:52.830
but he found the gloves

00:22:52.914 --> 00:22:54.165
- when Nicky...
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:55.374
Who's that?

00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:59.295
That's Jonah. He's the Knight
Rider Car of soccer.

00:23:10.306 --> 00:23:11.474
Bring it in.

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.227
Whistle, whistle. Bring it in.

00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:15.478
Bring it in, team!

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:18.648
Sit down, sit down.

00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:22.652
That was terrible.

00:23:23.236 --> 00:23:25.071
You're just pissing around
out there.

00:23:25.238 --> 00:23:26.948
You need passion
to play this game.

00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.658
It's embarrassing.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.244
I've every right to put
my foot up all your asses.

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:35.206
Oh, that's funny to you?

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:37.083
Well, yeah.
I mean, it's a funny image.

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.377
Sorry.
Just trying to have fun.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:40.628
Football's fun.

00:23:41.212 --> 00:23:42.588
Football's fun.

00:23:42.964 --> 00:23:44.257
I'll tell you what's not fun.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.467
Watching you prancing
and parading,

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.803
fixing your hair
like My Little Pony.

00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:50.555
That's not fun.

00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:54.433
Armani.

00:23:55.143 --> 00:23:57.603
This young gentleman here
is what I'm talking about.

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:01.399
This is passion personified.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.110
If I had 11 Armani's,
I could conquer the world.

00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:07.196
But alas, I only have the one.

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:08.739
I'll take that.

00:24:09.407 --> 00:24:11.117
You know what?
I've had it for today.

00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:13.035
I'm going to leave Armani
in charge.

00:24:14.078 --> 00:24:17.123
He's going to be my eyes
and my ears.

00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:19.876
Anything Armani says, you do.

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:24.213
Armani?
What shall we do today?

00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:29.218
Everybody,
shoulder exercise up.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.015
Up, down, up, down.
Double time.

00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.977
Welcome
to your voice mailbox.

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:41.189
You have 18 saved messages.

00:24:42.023 --> 00:24:43.566
First saved message.

00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:45.359
Hey, Dad.

00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:46.694
I just saw you called.

00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.779
Where are you?

00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:53.451
Seriously. Like, where
in the world is Thomas Rongen?

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.662
Okay, call me back.

00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:23.105
Old tin cans,
old tin cans!

00:25:23.272 --> 00:25:24.815
That's what I'm collecting.

00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:28.778
People just throw them away.
They wash up on the shore.

00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:33.366
They used to be valuable.
Not so much anymore.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:34.742
Is she talking to me?

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:38.496
You're feeling alone,
because you are alone.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.249
Like these old metal cans.

00:25:41.666 --> 00:25:43.376
This isn't happening.
It's a mirage.

00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:45.294
Yes, this is happening.

00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:49.465
You're just a skinny
white guy, sitting there

00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:51.884
looking out to sea
for answers.

00:25:54.095 --> 00:25:59.100
But maybe the answers you seek
are right in front of you.

00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:03.938
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:05.856
Even tin cans.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.567
Not that plastic bottle there, though.

00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:10.569
Not that. Not touching that.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.365
Family is what you make it.

00:26:14.824 --> 00:26:18.327
Here I come,
the old tin can lady.

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.329
- Looking for my tin cans...
- Tin cans.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.789
...that's what I do

00:26:21.872 --> 00:26:23.249
- all day. Oh!
Darling!

00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.960
Oh, Tavita, you idiot!
- Did you speak to him?

00:26:26.127 --> 00:26:27.378
Yes, but what was all that

00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.797
tin can mumbo-jumbo shit
you made me say

00:26:29.964 --> 00:26:31.507
and all that "family is what
you make it" crap?

00:26:31.674 --> 00:26:33.801
It sounded like
that old lady from The Matrix.

00:26:34.093 --> 00:26:35.094
Nah, he's a Palagi.

00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:36.846
White people love
all that spiritual stuff.

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:38.806
Can you imagine the world
without yoga?

00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:40.975
There'd be all this
unstretchy white people around

00:26:41.142 --> 00:26:43.477
- with no ethnic tattoos.
- And no white dreadlocks.

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:45.688
Exactly! They need us.

00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:48.024
And I need that coach.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.610
Hey, guys!
That's great warming-upping.

00:26:51.819 --> 00:26:53.612
- Doing really well.
Ace.

00:26:54.322 --> 00:26:56.240
Oh! Mr. Rongen.

00:26:56.574 --> 00:26:57.950
- Ace.
- Yeah?

00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.995
You know, I just had the most
profound conversation.

00:27:01.162 --> 00:27:02.705
It was all about tin cans.

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:06.334
Our team, they're like a bunch
of tin cans.

00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:07.585
Look at them.

00:27:07.752 --> 00:27:09.295
Discarded, crumpled,

00:27:09.462 --> 00:27:10.463
sitting in a bunker,

00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:12.381
waiting for an apocalypse
that may never come.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.133
But guess what, Ace,

00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:15.843
we're gonna give those cans
a purpose.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.094
What's that, boss?

00:27:17.887 --> 00:27:19.388
We're going to start
a nuclear war.

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:22.350
Gather around, tin cans.

00:27:22.433 --> 00:27:23.476
Come on, tin cans.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.894
We're going
to practice free kicks.

00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:26.312
Hustle, double time!

00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:27.772
Double time,
double time, hustle.

00:27:27.938 --> 00:27:29.732
The art of taking
the free kick

00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:30.816
is about distraction.

00:27:31.192 --> 00:27:32.276
Here we go.

00:27:33.277 --> 00:27:35.279
- Whoa, whoa.
Oh.

00:27:35.363 --> 00:27:36.364
And that's how it's done.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:37.782
Distraction!

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.825
Distraction. Follow my move.

00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.285
Hey!

00:27:41.452 --> 00:27:43.537
A small game called
the Human Hurdle.

00:27:43.704 --> 00:27:46.374
- And jump! And jump!

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.834
Stop.
You go around.

00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:51.128
Cheese and pepper,
cheese and pepper!

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.964
The object of the game
is to hit the moving target.

00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:55.633
Useless.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.802
Baa, baa
black sheep

00:27:57.885 --> 00:27:59.053
Have you any wool?

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:00.262
Keep the melody, please.

00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:01.680
Yes, sir, yes, sir

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:02.848
Everybody wait.

00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:04.308
Stop play. Stop play.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.519
Jaiyah, any reason
why you're late?

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:07.853
Everybody else seemed

00:28:07.937 --> 00:28:09.897
to turn up on time
for training today.

00:28:10.064 --> 00:28:11.941
Why don't you run over there
and do some slaloms.

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:14.068
Off you go. Let's go.

00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:16.153
Talk to one another.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.488
Come on! Concentrate.

00:28:26.163 --> 00:28:28.416
The object is turning speed.
Hustle, hustle.

00:28:28.582 --> 00:28:29.667
Hustle, hustle, bustle.

00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:31.043
You know what?
Forget about it.

00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:34.171
Forget about it. Hup, hup, hup.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.424
- Guys, head up, head up.
Get low, get low.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.175
Cheese and pepper!
- Get out of the way here.

00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:39.552
Cheese and pepper!

00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:43.264
The object is to get the ball
in the net.

00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:44.640
Concentrate.

00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:45.933
Look where you're shooting it.

00:28:46.183 --> 00:28:47.560
What the hell!

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:50.980
Don't look at me,
look at the ball.

00:29:00.448 --> 00:29:02.491
Control it, Daru.
What is that? Is that a pass?

00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:03.909
One touch. Pass.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.412
One touch. Pass, pass.
Come on.

00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:08.664
Jaiyah, focus.

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:10.875
You're controlling
the back line, let's go!

00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.042
And how would I say,

00:29:12.126 --> 00:29:13.669
"You're all useless.
I'm out of here"?

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.131
Way too long.
Forget it.

00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:18.340
Trust.

00:29:18.841 --> 00:29:21.844
Trust. Trust, okay. Trust.

00:29:23.262 --> 00:29:25.514
That's it, don't touch me.
Trust is broken.

00:29:28.893 --> 00:29:31.103
All right.
It's getting serious now.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.148
We're going to play
full 90 minutes with the ball.

00:29:34.315 --> 00:29:37.234
Shirts versus bibs.
Three touches only. Go!

00:29:37.401 --> 00:29:40.070
Go, go, go!

00:29:40.738 --> 00:29:41.947
That's it, push up,
push up.

00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:43.949
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

00:29:44.992 --> 00:29:46.035
A little bit of urgency.

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:47.953
Look at him, he's got all
the space in the world.

00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:49.914
Jaiyah! Look alive.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.832
Concentrate. Focus, Jaiyah.

00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:54.502
What are you waiting for?
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.547
No, no, no! Squeeze him, Daru.

00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:00.132
Stay on your feet, man.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.345
Jaiyah, what are you doing
over there?

00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:05.804
Stop playing with your hair.

00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.265
What the hell's that?
Come here.

00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.017
Why are you fixing your hair?

00:30:10.184 --> 00:30:12.269
This isn't some
voguing competition.

00:30:12.353 --> 00:30:13.687
This is international soccer.

00:30:14.563 --> 00:30:16.899
Stop that.
Get your shit together.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.070
Johnny, come back here
when I'm talking to you.

00:30:27.117 --> 00:30:28.786
My name is not Johnny.

00:30:28.953 --> 00:30:30.120
Your registered name
is Johnny.

00:30:30.204 --> 00:30:31.747
You'll be playing
under the name Johnny.

00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:33.207
And that's what I'm going
to be calling you.

00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:35.376
So, get used to it, Johnny.

00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:41.465
Call me Johnny,
again, one more time,

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:43.300
and see what happens.

00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:48.264
Johnny.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.101
Oh, Jaiyah, no, he's a coach.

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:53.602
Naughty, naughty.

00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:54.895
- Yeah, yeah.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.691
It's okay. I'm all right.

00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:01.735
Okay.

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:03.737
Things are getting
pretty intense.

00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:06.949
So, it's, uh, time
to take a break, maybe.

00:31:08.117 --> 00:31:09.451
Ace, call lunch.

00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:11.787
You heard the man.
Have some lunch.

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:13.539
Cooling down.

00:31:13.914 --> 00:31:16.375
Especially, if your name
rhymes with fire.

00:31:18.961 --> 00:31:20.796
Sixth saved message.

00:31:21.922 --> 00:31:23.090
Okay, so,

00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.050
you don't actually know
how phones work

00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:26.260
is the vibe I'm getting.

00:31:26.719 --> 00:31:28.554
When it makes a noise,
you answer it.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.598
I mean, I know
you're probably working

00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:31.890
with the team right now but

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:36.395
maybe stop yelling at them
for a second and call me back.

00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:38.147
I'm around.

00:31:46.155 --> 00:31:47.615
Hey, celebrity guy!

00:31:47.698 --> 00:31:49.283
Saw you on
Who's On The Plane,

00:31:49.366 --> 00:31:50.409
- coach.

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:53.579
Soccer coach, you got the
toughest job on the island.

00:31:53.746 --> 00:31:55.164
These guys are
shocking.

00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:57.499
- Shocking.
Ah, coach!

00:31:57.583 --> 00:32:00.252
Welcome
to our humble restaurant.

00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:02.588
Tavita's Restaurant.
My restaurant.

00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:04.006
How many jobs have you got?

00:32:04.173 --> 00:32:05.758
Ah, we all have a few jobs.

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.427
We have to earn enough money
to keep the team going.

00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:11.597
- Garçon! Son, Daru.
- What?

00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:14.099
Please, escort
our esteemed guest

00:32:14.183 --> 00:32:16.769
to our exclusive
al fresco table.

00:32:16.935 --> 00:32:20.147
Please. No special treatment.
I'll sit outside.

00:32:24.068 --> 00:32:26.153
They look up to you.
They depend on you.

00:32:26.403 --> 00:32:28.530
You got to be demanding.
But kind.

00:32:29.365 --> 00:32:30.366
Hello.

00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:32.034
Sir.

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.204
Something to drink?

00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:37.748
Whiskey, beer, wine?

00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:40.125
Yeah, we got all those.
Which one?

00:32:40.417 --> 00:32:41.794
Whiskey, beer, and wine.

00:32:47.675 --> 00:32:48.884
Mr. Rongen.

00:32:49.093 --> 00:32:51.595
Please accept this appetizer

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:54.098
of raw fish marinated
in coconut cream.

00:32:54.431 --> 00:32:56.266
It's a real classic
of the islands.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.685
And it's on the house.

00:32:58.143 --> 00:32:59.186
How are things going?

00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:01.397
I can honestly say it's the
worst bunch of players

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.648
I've ever come across
in my life.

00:33:02.731 --> 00:33:03.732
Oh.

00:33:03.816 --> 00:33:05.818
I have very particular
methods.

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:07.528
And unless I get
the support I need,

00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:08.779
I just don't think
it's going to work.

00:33:09.738 --> 00:33:12.324
We have our own methods too.
Traditions.

00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:14.034
It's like with that appetizer.

00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:15.244
I'm sure that little fish

00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:17.246
didn't think that one day
it would be chopped up,

00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:18.580
covered in spring onions,

00:33:18.664 --> 00:33:20.332
a little bit of tomato,
yellow pepper,

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:22.793
lemon zest
and a dash of chili.

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.295
But if you ask anyone
around here,

00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:27.464
it's a better fish
because of it.

00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:30.634
You may need
to just marinate, too.

00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:32.386
See how you feel.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.555
One goal.

00:33:36.265 --> 00:33:37.558
One goal.

00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:40.894
One goal.

00:33:42.229 --> 00:33:43.439
One goal.

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:46.525
One goal.

00:33:49.027 --> 00:33:50.070
One goal.

00:34:00.164 --> 00:34:02.040
Wow. That's really good.
It's really good!

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:07.921
I want to swing

00:34:28.192 --> 00:34:30.444
Yes, I'm going to need
immediate backup.

00:34:30.527 --> 00:34:32.571
I'm engaged in a car chase.

00:34:32.738 --> 00:34:34.490
Wow, really?
- Looks like a Palagi guy,

00:34:34.656 --> 00:34:35.824
he's driving like a maniac.

00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:39.077
He's maybe doing 35, 36 MPHs.

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:41.830
That's fast!
- Also, um, my, uh,

00:34:41.914 --> 00:34:43.499
my siren's not working.

00:34:43.707 --> 00:34:45.959
Oh, jeez!
Okay, stay safe, Rambo.

00:34:46.126 --> 00:34:47.294
Oh, and can you get some kava

00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:48.712
from Uncle Pese
on the way home?

00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.631
Uh, copy that.
Yeah, okay, I love you, Mom.

00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:52.633
- I love you too, baby.
- Okay, love you.

00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:01.642
- Shit.
Yeah,

00:35:01.725 --> 00:35:03.018
this is the policeman.

00:35:03.185 --> 00:35:06.104
Can you please pull over
to the side? Yes.

00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:13.153
You're going to get
out of the car

00:35:13.237 --> 00:35:14.446
on the count of three.

00:35:14.655 --> 00:35:15.739
Are you ready?

00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.033
Three.

00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:21.078
Thank you.

00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:24.498
Okay, you punk rocker.

00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:27.668
Oh, hey, it's the guy
from the TV!

00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:29.461
That's me.
What seems to be the problem?

00:35:29.628 --> 00:35:32.297
Oh, I'll tell you what the...

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:34.174
Hey, you okay?

00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:38.011
Hey. Let it out, big guy.
I got you.

00:35:43.851 --> 00:35:46.061
Oh, thank you.
I'm feeling better now.

00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:47.980
Now, listen, normally,

00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.857
I'd lock you up
and throw away the key.

00:35:50.023 --> 00:35:51.024
But right now,

00:35:51.108 --> 00:35:53.110
I'm just more angry
at my mango juice can.

00:35:53.277 --> 00:35:55.404
You stupid can!

00:35:58.031 --> 00:35:59.074
Fleetwood Mac!

00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:01.618
That's a hell of a right foot
you got there,

00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:03.537
Fa'agaloagliga.

00:36:03.704 --> 00:36:04.705
Rambo.

00:36:05.372 --> 00:36:06.373
Rambo.

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:10.210
Gentlemen, allow me to present
our newest recruit,

00:36:11.044 --> 00:36:12.546
Detective Rambo.

00:36:13.046 --> 00:36:15.465
We already kicked him out.
He tried to arrest us all.

00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:16.967
You were playing
on private property.

00:36:17.134 --> 00:36:18.427
Yeah, that property
is my dad's property.

00:36:18.594 --> 00:36:19.887
Well, I don't make up
the rules, okay?

00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:21.096
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:25.142
Bravo.

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:27.102
You've just fallen for the
oldest trick in the book.

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:28.979
Can't you see?

00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:30.856
This is exactly what
they want from us.

00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.316
- Who?
Them!

00:36:33.317 --> 00:36:34.735
The Imperialists.

00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:36.904
Divide and conquer.

00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:38.655
But we're not going
to let them.

00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:40.782
We've worked too long
and hard for this.

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:42.743
You've only been here
a few days.

00:36:43.118 --> 00:36:44.953
Rome was built in a day, man.

00:36:45.662 --> 00:36:47.289
I think we're doing
pretty well.

00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:48.999
Now, how about this?

00:36:49.458 --> 00:36:52.377
As a team, together,
we climb that mountain.

00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:53.879
Who's with me?

00:36:54.338 --> 00:36:55.339
No.

00:36:55.422 --> 00:36:56.423
Coach,
my ankle is hurting me.

00:36:56.506 --> 00:36:58.508
I can't hear you.
Who's with me?

00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:00.344
No, no, my mom is
expecting me.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.639
Come on, guys!
We're all in this together.

00:37:03.805 --> 00:37:05.223
Now, who's going to climb
that mountain

00:37:05.307 --> 00:37:06.516
with me as a team?

00:37:07.017 --> 00:37:08.018
Are you with me?

00:37:08.977 --> 00:37:10.520
Are you with me, my team?

00:37:11.313 --> 00:37:12.731
- Yeah, okay, then, yeah.
- All right!

00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:14.274
Okay, let's go. Yes.
Go.

00:37:14.441 --> 00:37:15.609
Let's go!
Yeah.

00:37:15.776 --> 00:37:17.152
Now, we're making
some progress.

00:37:22.658 --> 00:37:24.117
Wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.535
Don't sit down.

00:37:25.786 --> 00:37:27.913
We're not there yet.
We haven't even started.

00:37:28.205 --> 00:37:30.791
- Ace, what's going on?
- It's curfew time.

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:31.917
What?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.211
The bell means curfew.
It's time to pray.

00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:37.422
The whole island stops.
Same time, every day.

00:37:37.798 --> 00:37:39.508
But what am I supposed to do?
I'm not religious.

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:41.468
Pretend?

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:46.181
Okay. I'll pray for you.

00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:49.184
When did that
ever work? Tavita!

00:37:52.813 --> 00:37:54.398
I've got three weeks left
to the qualifiers.

00:37:54.481 --> 00:37:55.565
We got a lot of work to do.

00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.484
So, tomorrow, I'm going
to start with fitness drills

00:37:57.651 --> 00:37:59.444
to see how many of them
can last a full 90 minutes.

00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:01.029
Ooh. Ah.

00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:03.407
Thomas, ah,
we won't be training tomorrow.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.242
- Why not?
- It's Sunday.

00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:06.910
- So?
- The team won't train

00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.412
on a Sunday.
That would be a sin.

00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:09.496
Jesus Christ.

00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:11.289
Mr. Rongen,
you are very welcome

00:38:11.373 --> 00:38:12.416
to join us on Sunday.

00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:14.501
It could be a nice experience.

00:38:14.668 --> 00:38:16.169
You can see
how we worship God.

00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:18.255
This is church.
Football is church.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.215
You've got zero commitment.

00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:22.009
We're very committed
to church.

00:38:22.175 --> 00:38:24.219
This place is a carnival
of crap.

00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:25.554
Hey, look at this,
look at this.

00:38:25.721 --> 00:38:26.847
This bit, right here.
Right here.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:27.931
Off goes the chair.

00:38:28.015 --> 00:38:29.641
- Ooh.
This guy's been fired

00:38:29.725 --> 00:38:30.934
from his last three jobs
because

00:38:31.018 --> 00:38:32.019
he can't control himself.

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:33.770
I don't know.
He seems okay, now.

00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:35.022
Maybe he's different.

00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:36.273
I've coached
11-year-olds

00:38:36.356 --> 00:38:37.357
better than your players!

00:38:38.608 --> 00:38:39.651
Sure.

00:38:39.818 --> 00:38:40.861
I mean, look at this place.

00:38:41.028 --> 00:38:43.155
You've got a keyboard
and mouse and no screen!

00:38:43.613 --> 00:38:45.365
None of this shit
makes any sense.

00:38:45.532 --> 00:38:47.617
You don't even have a full
squad of players out there.

00:38:47.868 --> 00:38:49.745
No wonder you're the worst
team in the world.

00:38:49.911 --> 00:38:51.747
Mr. Rongen,
you have made your point

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:53.290
and now let me make mine.

00:38:53.582 --> 00:38:56.877
Now, we here at FFAS
are honored that you are here.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.463
We want to improve,
we want to learn from you.

00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:02.424
But we will not deny
who we are just to win.

00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:04.676
These are our customs.
These are our ways.

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.803
Your ways are shit.
You're failing.

00:39:07.596 --> 00:39:09.806
It's torture
coaching this team.

00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:14.936
Thomas, we were
under the impression

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.355
that you wanted to be here.

00:39:17.522 --> 00:39:19.816
But if that is the wrong
impression that we are under,

00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:21.818
then you are free to go.

00:39:21.985 --> 00:39:24.112
Seek your happiness.

00:39:24.488 --> 00:39:25.947
Unhappiness is a curse

00:39:26.031 --> 00:39:27.949
that I would not wish
on anyone.

00:39:33.246 --> 00:39:35.332
Okay. I quit.

00:39:46.218 --> 00:39:47.302
I told you guys.

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.351
Hello?

00:39:54.518 --> 00:39:55.977
- Can you hear me?
Yeah.

00:39:56.144 --> 00:40:00.232
So, uh, here's the news.
Fresh off the press. I quit.

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.858
- You can't quit.
- I quit.

00:40:02.025 --> 00:40:03.360
Today, officially.

00:40:03.527 --> 00:40:05.445
- Well, then go un-quit.
- Once you quit,

00:40:05.612 --> 00:40:07.697
you got to commit to the quit.
You know this.

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:08.907
It's like this team,

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.450
- they don't even want to win.

00:40:10.617 --> 00:40:12.452
For them, it's like
some sort of game.

00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:13.662
It is a game, Thomas.

00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:15.038
It's a sport.

00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:16.498
I can't work with these guys.

00:40:16.665 --> 00:40:17.833
I can't help them.

00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:20.794
Thomas, we didn't send
you there to help them.

00:40:20.961 --> 00:40:22.671
We sent you there to help you.

00:40:25.132 --> 00:40:27.259
I don't need help.
I'm coming home.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.344
Home, I'm sorry, Thomas,

00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:32.597
but where is home now?

00:40:36.268 --> 00:40:37.352
Look,

00:40:38.228 --> 00:40:39.312
we'll be there
in a couple weeks

00:40:39.396 --> 00:40:41.398
for the qualifiers, okay?
And we'll get a drink.

00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:42.566
- All right?

00:41:11.011 --> 00:41:12.012
Dear Lord,

00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:13.305
if you could please

00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:15.432
let the coach come back
wherever he is,

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.475
to help us score
that one goal.

00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:18.643
Just one.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.270
Not too much to ask, I think,

00:41:20.437 --> 00:41:22.189
given we go to church
every Sunday

00:41:22.272 --> 00:41:23.523
and give 10 percent
of our income.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:24.941
But, uh, hey!

00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:27.319
All in your time.
Amene.

00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:29.154
Amene.

00:41:31.573 --> 00:41:32.741
Ah,
that didn't work.

00:41:32.908 --> 00:41:35.952
Ace, looks like
you're coaching today.

00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:40.707
Okay, just go for a run
to warm up your bodies, huh?

00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.085
Okay, Dad.

00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.921
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:48.298
But I was just pissed
because...

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:50.800
because you should be here
for this.

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.470
They asked me to lead
the team out on Saturday.

00:41:54.429 --> 00:41:55.513
Where are you?

00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:11.112
Hi, coach.

00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:14.282
Hi.

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:18.411
I just wanted to come by
and say sorry

00:42:18.578 --> 00:42:20.455
about body slamming you
to the ground

00:42:20.538 --> 00:42:21.998
and choking you, and

00:42:22.165 --> 00:42:24.668
also, just wanted to say
thank you

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.711
for keeping me on the team

00:42:27.087 --> 00:42:28.255
so far.

00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:32.759
Well, uh, I'd like
to apologize too

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:34.636
for not respecting your name,

00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:36.513
Jaiyah.

00:42:39.557 --> 00:42:41.768
Here. Peace offering.

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:46.273
- What is it?
- It's from team lunch.

00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:47.440
You keep missing out

00:42:47.524 --> 00:42:49.234
because you get angry
and run away.

00:42:50.026 --> 00:42:51.861
You know,
you should eat first.

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.822
And, then get angry.

00:42:55.115 --> 00:42:56.283
Makes sense.

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:58.034
Will you join me?

00:42:59.327 --> 00:43:00.328
Sure.

00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:02.998
College is cool.

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:05.333
And I do some performing
when I'm not studying.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.127
So, do you think you'll come
back to the island

00:43:07.294 --> 00:43:08.461
once you finish your degree?

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:10.338
No. There's really not much

00:43:10.422 --> 00:43:11.756
on the island
for young people.

00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:13.508
The job choices come down

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.927
to the tuna cannery
or the army.

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:19.097
And I don't really like fish
or guns.

00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:21.558
So, you think you'll stay
in Hawaii then?

00:43:22.225 --> 00:43:23.727
Hmm. Maybe.

00:43:23.893 --> 00:43:25.812
I mean, there's not
as many fa'afafine there,

00:43:25.895 --> 00:43:28.356
so you do get
a bit more prejudice.

00:43:30.191 --> 00:43:31.901
So, I hear you're married?

00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:33.069
And you have a daughter.

00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:38.074
Yeah, but tell me more about
this, um, fa'afafine thing.

00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:39.659
What do you want to know?

00:43:41.119 --> 00:43:42.871
I mean, what are you
down there?

00:43:43.288 --> 00:43:44.539
Does it really matter to you?

00:43:44.706 --> 00:43:46.624
Well, it matters
to the officials in the game.

00:43:46.875 --> 00:43:49.085
Okay, well,
right now I'm legal.

00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:51.212
But I have been taking
hormones for a while and...

00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:52.380
Right now?

00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:54.799
Let's just say
that eventually,

00:43:54.883 --> 00:43:57.552
I technically won't qualify
for the team.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:01.973
Can we talk soccer?

00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:03.516
Yes.

00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:05.894
What am I watching here?

00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:07.771
Why is everyone bunched up
like old ladies

00:44:07.854 --> 00:44:09.272
gathered at a cake convention?

00:44:09.439 --> 00:44:11.191
Well, how are we supposed
to know about formation?

00:44:11.358 --> 00:44:13.401
No one taught us,
including you.

00:44:14.736 --> 00:44:15.737
Fair point.

00:44:16.237 --> 00:44:17.238
Look at this guy.

00:44:17.322 --> 00:44:18.406
Just standing there
in open space

00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:19.991
doing nothing.
Reminds me of you.

00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:22.369
That is me.

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:23.870
Oh.

00:44:24.496 --> 00:44:26.873
Well, you're a natural born
defender.

00:44:26.956 --> 00:44:27.957
Not a forward.

00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:29.667
Wait, who is that in goal?

00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:31.503
That's Nicky Salapu.

00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.671
- That's Nicky Salapu?
- Yeah.

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:35.757
The guy that let in
over 30 goals?

00:44:35.924 --> 00:44:37.842
Yeah, but he saved another 60.

00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:39.511
He looks pretty good.

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:41.012
He's one of the best players
we've ever had.

00:44:41.096 --> 00:44:42.138
He's a legend.

00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:43.515
A legend of the fallen.

00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:46.017
- Shut up.
- You shut up, it's my house.

00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:47.352
It's my island.

00:44:47.519 --> 00:44:49.187
I don't even know
why we're watching this.

00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:51.606
Because most of these players
are retired.

00:44:51.773 --> 00:44:52.857
But they only gave up

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:55.235
because everyone else
gave up on them.

00:44:55.819 --> 00:44:57.612
But if you came back
to coach us,

00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:58.905
I could help you find them.

00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:00.865
Because they're still good.

00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:03.743
I'll be the judge of that.

00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:12.085
Hey, famous guy and Jaiyah!

00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:20.552
Thomas Rongen. Nicky Salapu.

00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:25.557
Well I'll be
a son of a bitch.

00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:28.476
The chickens have come home
to roast.

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:33.148
You're the best goalkeeper
American Samoa ever had.

00:45:34.274 --> 00:45:36.943
I let in over 30 goals
at international level.

00:45:38.027 --> 00:45:40.864
You're the best goalkeeper
American Samoa ever had.

00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:44.451
Isn't there something
about that defeat

00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:45.577
that still haunts you?

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.537
- That you can't let go of?
- Of course.

00:45:48.288 --> 00:45:50.373
I replay that match on Xbox.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.250
American Samoa
versus Australia.

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:53.376
But I play alone.

00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:56.880
And I get my revenge every day
by beating them 32, nil.

00:45:57.422 --> 00:45:59.174
Don't you want revenge
on Australia?

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.092
But instead of Australia,

00:46:01.176 --> 00:46:03.386
it would be on a bunch
of other Polynesian islands.

00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:06.222
Some of them are close
to Australia.

00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:09.309
How did you get
this coaching job?

00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:10.435
You're terrible at this.

00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:12.687
Can you just come back
to the team?

00:46:13.396 --> 00:46:16.900
They need work, yeah.
And they need a lot of work,

00:46:17.317 --> 00:46:20.737
but I see a bunch of guys
in that team, including her

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.781
who all work multiple jobs
just to play.

00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.658
Who've got more heart
and they're dreaming bigger

00:46:25.825 --> 00:46:27.452
than nearly any
of the jaded fools

00:46:27.535 --> 00:46:28.536
that mess around
in the pro league

00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:30.121
for money they don't deserve.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.291
Don't tell them I said that.

00:46:34.918 --> 00:46:36.669
- Is he interested in playing?

00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:38.338
No interest, whatsoever.

00:46:38.796 --> 00:46:39.797
Who's next?

00:46:45.553 --> 00:46:47.764
That's called chutzpah,
Armani.

00:46:48.097 --> 00:46:49.265
And we like it.

00:46:49.432 --> 00:46:50.558
Excuse me, Squire?

00:46:50.725 --> 00:46:52.018
- Stretch the muscle.
- Ace?

00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:54.479
Mr. Rongen!
I thought you'd abandoned us.

00:46:54.646 --> 00:46:56.022
Ace, I'd like to apologize.

00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:57.273
- Oh.
- But I won't.

00:46:57.357 --> 00:46:59.317
- Oh.
- As a rule, I don't apologize.

00:46:59.484 --> 00:47:02.028
I'm not apologizing
for that, either. So, sorry.

00:47:02.195 --> 00:47:04.113
Daru? Daru, Daru.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.574
Look, I know
you don't like me.

00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:08.034
I don't like me.

00:47:08.201 --> 00:47:10.119
But we need to work together.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.248
This formation is known
as the Sad Snowman.

00:47:13.414 --> 00:47:15.124
This player, interchangeable
with this player.

00:47:15.291 --> 00:47:16.292
This can cross here,

00:47:16.459 --> 00:47:18.878
switch it around,
works this way too.

00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:20.755
So, who we got next?

00:47:28.346 --> 00:47:29.389
We got another one.

00:47:29.556 --> 00:47:30.807
Nice one, Armani.

00:47:30.974 --> 00:47:33.142
Wax on, wax off.

00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:35.728
Wax on, wax off.

00:47:35.895 --> 00:47:37.063
We've also got
the three pigs.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.565
The wolf is coming
all the way back here.

00:47:38.731 --> 00:47:39.983
He's going to blow
your house down.

00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:41.484
This is where we want to go.

00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:43.444
All roads lead to Rome.

00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:45.863
What is this shit?

00:47:45.947 --> 00:47:47.657
Fucking Sharpie.
Get me another board.

00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:49.200
Think of it like a fish.

00:47:49.534 --> 00:47:52.704
On its own, slimy, smelly,
tasteless somewhat.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.957
But add some coconut cream,
lemon zest, chili,

00:47:56.124 --> 00:47:57.709
let that sucker marinate.

00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:59.419
Now you've got
something special.

00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:01.462
Allow yourself to marinate.

00:48:01.546 --> 00:48:02.880
You'll be a better fish
for it.

00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:04.549
Thank you, coach.

00:48:05.133 --> 00:48:06.884
Ice is your friend.

00:48:07.051 --> 00:48:09.012
It will help those muscles.

00:48:09.178 --> 00:48:10.972
Oh, got you in the nads there.

00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:12.974
Just another 25 minutes.

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:19.606
Three, four.
And then, other side.

00:48:19.772 --> 00:48:21.649
Way off! Miss.

00:48:22.442 --> 00:48:24.694
- He finds it.

00:48:24.777 --> 00:48:27.363
Get up. Not at the top yet.
Keep going.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.240
I know it's hard,
but if we can do this

00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:30.908
as a team, we have a chance.

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.910
We've got defense sorted.

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:34.954
- But our midfield...
- Mm-hmm.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.248
All right, my man.

00:48:37.332 --> 00:48:38.625
- All right.
- There you go.

00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:39.709
Thank you, coach.

00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:40.793
- See you Monday?
- For sure.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.545
- I won't let you down, coach.
- Amazing.

00:48:43.546 --> 00:48:44.589
Excellent.

00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:51.804
So, who's next?

00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.729
Nice.
Nice, Daru. Good energy.

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.773
Good energy. Good, good, good.

00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.691
Hop, hop, hop. Bunny rabbit.

00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:04.901
Push, push, push.

00:49:05.068 --> 00:49:06.486
Good.
Control that back line.

00:49:06.653 --> 00:49:09.113
That's it, Jaiyah, leadership.
That's what I'm talking about.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.326
Pelé, Maradona, Rongen. Whoo!

00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:15.662
Wax on, wax off.

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.830
Wax on, wax off.

00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:19.999
Wax on, wax off.

00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:21.709
Look, right here. Maldini.

00:49:43.022 --> 00:49:44.315
Keep it up, keep it up.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.984
Keep going, keep going.

00:49:47.068 --> 00:49:48.569
I know it's hard,
but keep going.

00:49:50.113 --> 00:49:51.948
I know you can make it
to the top.

00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:54.992
Come on, guys,
keep going, keep going.

00:49:55.702 --> 00:49:57.286
Don't stop, don't stop.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.798
Oh, God!

00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:13.594
Oh, God. It's beautiful.

00:50:13.761 --> 00:50:14.846
You okay, coach?

00:50:15.012 --> 00:50:16.222
It's beautiful.

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:18.516
Oh, my God.

00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:20.560
It looked so easy
from the bottom.

00:50:20.643 --> 00:50:22.854
Can't breathe.

00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:25.314
This spot here, this place,

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.943
tells of how
your brave brothers

00:50:29.777 --> 00:50:33.614
fought to protect
American Samoa

00:50:34.323 --> 00:50:36.993
and the rest of the world
against evil.

00:50:37.744 --> 00:50:40.413
Well, tomorrow, we set off

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.874
for the greatest war
of them all!

00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:46.753
The war for World Cup
qualification.

00:50:46.919 --> 00:50:48.254
Yeah!

00:50:49.756 --> 00:50:51.382
Oh, my God,
the air is thin up here.

00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:54.177
In two days' time,

00:50:56.012 --> 00:50:58.890
we face our first enemy,
Tonga.

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:02.560
Screw those guys!

00:51:03.895 --> 00:51:07.106
There have been so many wars
against those assholes.

00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:10.651
But the war of 1825,

00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:13.029
where they came to take...

00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:15.865
they came to take our tuna.

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:22.163
But we handed their asses
to them in a giant tuna can.

00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:25.792
Where am I?

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.877
Uh, Mr. Rongen,
are you feeling all right?

00:51:28.211 --> 00:51:30.379
What was that?
I still have to pack.

00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:32.256
I always leave packing

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.050
to the last minute.
It's so weird.

00:51:36.385 --> 00:51:39.347
Healing waters.
Yeah, take him down.

00:51:39.514 --> 00:51:41.265
Yeah. It's all right, coach.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.480
And so,
we turn to Matthew 17

00:51:47.647 --> 00:51:51.776
when a man says to lesu,
"Lord, have mercy on my son.

00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:53.653
"For he is a lunatic

00:51:54.153 --> 00:51:56.072
"and is very ill.

00:51:56.239 --> 00:51:58.282
"For he often falls
into the fire

00:51:58.366 --> 00:52:00.493
"and often into the water.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.037
"Very clumsy, my boy."

00:52:03.246 --> 00:52:06.833
And lesu said,
"Bring him here to me."

00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:08.459
Good old lesu.

00:52:08.626 --> 00:52:10.461
And lesu rebuked him.

00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:12.463
And the demon came out of him.

00:52:13.548 --> 00:52:16.050
And the boy was cured at once.

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.847
What a beautiful day.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:22.431
We give thanks

00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:26.269
for the beauties outside,
all the blessings.

00:52:26.435 --> 00:52:28.688
And, uh, before we get further

00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:30.690
into the proceedings,
a little housekeeping.

00:52:30.857 --> 00:52:32.775
Someone was seen
rifling around

00:52:32.859 --> 00:52:35.194
in, uh, one
of the dumpsters outside

00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:37.405
Sione Malacoco's
Fish and Chip Shop.

00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:38.865
Fess up, who was that?

00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.700
Trying to get
some leftover scraps.

00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:41.868
We don't do that.

00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:44.829
Okay? Now, what a day.

00:52:45.204 --> 00:52:46.581
Our wonderful team

00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:50.376
are going across the seas
to do the impossible.

00:52:51.627 --> 00:52:54.130
To go and win
a game of soccer.

00:52:55.256 --> 00:52:56.257
Wow!

00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.010
Wowie!

00:53:00.303 --> 00:53:02.388
Some would say that
the other teams are too big.

00:53:03.764 --> 00:53:05.349
Well, you know
what I say to them?

00:53:06.434 --> 00:53:07.602
Read the Bible.

00:53:07.977 --> 00:53:10.521
Have you ever heard
of a little guy called David

00:53:10.688 --> 00:53:13.316
fighting against a big guy
called the Goliath?

00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:16.110
That is a cautionary tale.

00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:17.320
Don't mess
with the little guy.

00:53:18.905 --> 00:53:20.031
And what we have here

00:53:20.114 --> 00:53:22.408
is a whole bunch
of little guys, don't we?

00:53:23.034 --> 00:53:25.161
Little guys,
who probably can't do it.

00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:27.288
Going off across the seas

00:53:27.371 --> 00:53:29.123
to fight a whole lot
of Goliaths.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.251
So, go, my little Davids.

00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:34.837
Let's take it to Mr. Goliath
out there.

00:53:35.338 --> 00:53:38.049
And let's get one
for American Samoa.

00:53:40.927 --> 00:53:41.928
Okay.

00:54:00.988 --> 00:54:02.406
So, off they go.

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:04.617
The American Samoan
soccer team

00:54:04.784 --> 00:54:07.620
hoping not to embarrass
the nation any further.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.581
Cut. That was really good,
Gus.

00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:16.295
Go, go, go, go!

00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:22.927
Tavita, let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on, move it!

00:54:26.806 --> 00:54:28.683
Let's get this bird
in the air!

00:54:35.398 --> 00:54:37.233
Wowie, that was some journey!

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.610
Yeah, I think I got
the jet lags. I need a nap.

00:54:39.777 --> 00:54:41.612
Guys, it was only
a 35 minute flight.

00:54:41.779 --> 00:54:42.780
Hey, guys!

00:54:42.863 --> 00:54:44.532
We've officially crossed
the date line.

00:54:44.699 --> 00:54:46.325
It's now yesterday.

00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:47.493
Time travel!

00:54:47.576 --> 00:54:48.744
- Look how fast

00:54:48.828 --> 00:54:50.246
these crazies are going.

00:54:50.413 --> 00:54:52.081
You know, someone's going
to get killed.

00:54:52.665 --> 00:54:55.501
Slow down. Heaven's full.

00:54:57.003 --> 00:54:58.337
Yo, some pretty sweet
digs.

00:54:58.671 --> 00:55:00.965
Okay, boys.
Good, you're settling in.

00:55:01.132 --> 00:55:03.050
Now, I just have
one note here.

00:55:03.134 --> 00:55:04.927
- Shh.
- The player reception is

00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:08.848
at 5:30 in the PM time.
And it's compulsory feetwear.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.725
So, wear something
on your feet, please.

00:55:11.183 --> 00:55:15.646
Like a slippers. Or a sandal.
Okay, yeah.

00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:16.856
- Thanks.

00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:23.904
- Tonga, Tonga.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.666
Nice of you guys to show up.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.001
That's very kind. Thank you.

00:55:37.168 --> 00:55:38.294
It was an insult!

00:55:38.627 --> 00:55:40.880
Oh, I should've known you were
going to put a twist on it.

00:55:41.047 --> 00:55:42.673
So, this is the competition.

00:55:44.133 --> 00:55:45.384
Nothing to worry about.

00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:47.636
No. Things have changed.
We got a new coach.

00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:49.680
Your coach is shit.
He's a failure.

00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:52.892
He's just like you.

00:55:53.267 --> 00:55:55.436
Obviously, you're trying
to get under our skin.

00:55:55.603 --> 00:55:58.898
But American Samoan skin
is impenetrable. Okay?

00:55:59.106 --> 00:56:01.442
Unless you got a sharp object

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.238
like, um, scissors, um,
screwdriver, needle.

00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:09.116
Anything that kind of comes
down to a really sharp point.

00:56:10.284 --> 00:56:12.161
- See you at the party.

00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:14.914
Don't forget to bring
your mascot.

00:56:25.966 --> 00:56:28.260
-"See you at the party later."
-"See you at the party later."

00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:30.221
"See you at the party later."

00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:31.472
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.017
Oh, the glitz, the glamour,

00:56:35.101 --> 00:56:36.977
the little flowers
on the table!

00:56:37.144 --> 00:56:38.562
Thomas, isn't this wonderful?

00:56:38.646 --> 00:56:41.482
Look, it's a veritable
who's that of world soccer.

00:56:41.816 --> 00:56:44.443
Let's get out of here, T.
Hit the beach.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.570
Six pack. This isn't us.

00:56:46.904 --> 00:56:48.364
We just got here.
The night's still young.

00:56:48.948 --> 00:56:50.491
- Oh, shit.
Hey!

00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:53.494
- There he is. There he is.
- T! T!

00:56:53.577 --> 00:56:55.496
Good day, mate.
Fancy seeing you here.

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:56.580
- What's happening?
- Hey! Hey!

00:56:56.664 --> 00:56:57.748
- Hi. All right.
- Hi.

00:56:57.832 --> 00:56:58.958
- What's going on, huh?
- Angus.

00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:00.042
Hey!

00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:01.502
Hey, give him a bumming.
Give him a bumming.

00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:03.420
- Oh, yeah. Bumming!
- Please.

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:05.840
- That's enough! That's enough!
- There you go. Right-oh.

00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:08.175
Settle down, mate.
It's good to see you.

00:57:09.301 --> 00:57:13.597
Tavita, this is, uh,
Angus, Keith. Socceroos.

00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:16.851
Oh, the Socceroos,
our arch nemesises.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.103
Hey? What are you...?

00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:20.563
Oh!

00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:22.231
American Samoa.

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:24.108
- We played in that game.
- We played in that game.

00:57:24.275 --> 00:57:25.526
Yeah, show him your tattoo.
Tattoo!

00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:26.819
Show him the tattoo,
show him the tattoo.

00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:28.070
- Wait, wait.
- He doesn't show

00:57:28.154 --> 00:57:29.155
- anyone this.
- Let me show you the tattoo.

00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:32.533
Oh!

00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:35.995
-  31, 31
-  31, 31, 31

00:57:36.162 --> 00:57:38.330
Ah, mate, we've moved on.
Put it away.

00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:39.999
No, we haven't.
It's part of our heritage.

00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.667
- I'm putting it away.
- So, hey?

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.419
Coaching American Samoa.

00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:45.462
Took the job
that nobody wanted.

00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:46.630
- He hasn't even been...
- Right! Good on ya.

00:57:46.714 --> 00:57:47.756
- ...fired yet.
- Hey, no, but seriously,

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.383
how they going?
You having a few wins?

00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:50.467
Yeah.

00:57:50.718 --> 00:57:52.094
We're, you know, we're...

00:57:52.261 --> 00:57:54.430
Oi! A-Train.

00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:56.182
- Toot toot!
A-Train!

00:57:56.932 --> 00:57:59.977
- Hi.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.437
Oh. Oh.

00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:05.608
- You look good.
- I missed you.

00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:07.067
You look good.

00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:08.277
Hey, there he is.

00:58:08.444 --> 00:58:10.070
- Hey.
- Alex. Hey.

00:58:10.529 --> 00:58:12.781
- You're looking kind of tired.
- Yes, I was going to say

00:58:12.865 --> 00:58:13.949
he's looking pretty tired,
isn't he?

00:58:14.116 --> 00:58:16.035
- Jet lag.
- Thank you.

00:58:16.118 --> 00:58:18.454
Um, Tavita, I'd like
to introduce you

00:58:18.537 --> 00:58:19.914
to Gail, my wife.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.498
- Separated.
- Oh.

00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:26.629
And this is Alex. Uh, my boss
and Gail's manfriend.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.591
Mr. Alex, on behalf of FFAS,
we just want to thank you

00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:31.800
for sending us
this super coach.

00:58:32.009 --> 00:58:33.636
He's really turned things
around.

00:58:34.803 --> 00:58:37.306
Great. Hey, can I talk to you
real quick outside?

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:38.849
- Sure.
- He wants to have a word

00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:39.934
with you outside.

00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:41.435
It won't take a second.

00:59:03.123 --> 00:59:04.124
Jaiyah!

00:59:05.334 --> 00:59:07.169
- Jaiyah!

00:59:08.754 --> 00:59:12.800
Man. I got to say,
really proud of you.

00:59:13.217 --> 00:59:15.469
We never thought
you'd make it. Congrats.

00:59:15.844 --> 00:59:17.721
Thanks, Alex. I mean,
I don't know what to say.

00:59:18.055 --> 00:59:19.974
I'm so proud of what
we've done here.

00:59:20.391 --> 00:59:22.142
Yeah. That's great.

00:59:22.226 --> 00:59:23.644
Not that it really matters
anymore.

00:59:25.062 --> 00:59:26.063
What do you mean?

00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:27.940
Don't worry about it.
It's just...

00:59:29.024 --> 00:59:30.943
You have shown
real improvement

00:59:31.026 --> 00:59:32.027
and that's what matters.

00:59:32.194 --> 00:59:34.113
I'm going to find you
a real job after this.

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:35.906
Alex, what are you saying?

00:59:38.701 --> 00:59:40.452
Look, Thomas,
I once had this dog.

00:59:40.619 --> 00:59:42.371
- I know about the dog.
- No, this is a different dog.

00:59:42.538 --> 00:59:44.331
You don't know this dog.
This dog was, uh,

00:59:44.415 --> 00:59:45.582
this dog was never any good.

00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:47.209
He was slow
and he couldn't run,

00:59:47.293 --> 00:59:49.461
and he never caught a stick
or did anything

00:59:49.628 --> 00:59:53.299
and so, the kindest thing
to do was to put him down.

00:59:54.383 --> 00:59:55.759
So, we killed him. Shot him.

00:59:56.635 --> 00:59:57.845
The team is the dog?

00:59:59.138 --> 01:00:01.390
Yeah, of course, the team
is the dog. It's a metaphor.

01:00:01.557 --> 01:00:03.100
How many dogs
do you think I've killed?

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:09.315
Look, the herd is only as fast
as its slowest animal.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:13.027
That's like
circle-of-life shit.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.237
Well, I believe
we can score a goal.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:17.740
A goal?
Who gives a shit about a goal?

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.158
What if we win the match?

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.951
Come on.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.911
I don't think they have a word
in their language for win.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:27.833
Look, man. Soccer is not
in their DNA. They're weak.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.294
No, Alex. They are not weak.

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:32.087
Some of the sacrifices
these players have made,

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:35.299
I mean, I'm talking about
life-altering sacrifices.

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:37.843
Look, I wish there was
something I could say

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.472
that would magically make you
feel better about this. Oh...

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:44.933
Hakuna matata.

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:00.866
The biggest battle

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:01.992
of our professional lives

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.119
all comes down to today.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:05.871
Now, either

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.500
we heal as a team

01:01:10.793 --> 01:01:13.337
- or we're going to crumble...

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.174
...inch by inch, play by play,
till we're finished.

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.218
We're in hell right now.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.678
We can stay here, get the shit
kicked out of us...

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.846
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.807
- Nightcap?
-   Sure.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:26.892
- Let's go.
- We can fight our way back...

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:28.936
- Oh, right.
- ...into the light.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.438
We can climb out of hell...

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:34.900
You know,
I think island life

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:36.985
has had a real effect on me.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:41.532
I feel like a new man.
Kind of Zen.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.825
You seem the same.

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:45.035
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:46.370
Are you happy?

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:47.788
I feel terrific.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:49.957
Tomorrow, we're going
to lose the match.

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.417
- Oh, come on.
- And get kicked out

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.961
- of International Football.
- You don't really think that.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.421
Pretty much the end
of my career.

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:56.547
You're the best.

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:58.048
I'm a laughingstock.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.716
You're a real buzzkill.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.510
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

01:02:04.263 --> 01:02:05.264
This is fun.

01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:06.807
This is fun.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.350
I miss you.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.810
I miss you too.

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:11.728
I love you.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.606
You define love as wanting
to be wanted.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.108
You just don't want
to be alone.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.069
Yeah?
That's the definition of love.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.197
I'll always have
a broken heart,

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:23.323
but I'm moving.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.993
Trying to move on.

01:02:27.286 --> 01:02:28.704
It's been two years
and I don't think

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.289
you're even talking about it.

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.084
What's there to talk about?

01:02:38.464 --> 01:02:40.174
All right,
let's not talk then.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.633
Come on, old man.

01:02:41.884 --> 01:02:44.803
Oh, God.
Are we doing this? Really?

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:46.555
Come on.
- Okay.

01:02:46.722 --> 01:02:47.764
I bet you can't get it.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.308
Well, you're supposed
to put it on the ground.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:50.767
- It's called football.

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.479
Hey!

01:02:53.562 --> 01:02:55.564
Don't tell me what to do.

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:59.109
You have a very fascinating
family dynamic, Thomas.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.445
You know,
I saw this German film.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.447
And they seemed to have
a similar arrangement.

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:07.159
You know, there was this
one woman and all these guys.

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.953
I couldn't figure out
which one was married to her

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.456
because they were
all acting like they were

01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:14.124
- married to her.
Lovely jogging.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.417
Best one I've seen yet.

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:20.756
Hey, it's Nicky!

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:23.300
Oh, Christmas has come early.
It's Nicky Salapu!

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:24.885
- Nicky Salapu!
- Nicky!

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:29.765
Where did he come from?

01:03:30.057 --> 01:03:31.099
Nicky Salapu.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.434
Okay, okay.
- Yes!

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.561
Guys, come on,
come on. Leave him alone.

01:03:34.645 --> 01:03:35.646
- Let's go, let's go.
Come on,

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:37.314
- do your stretching.
- Let's get some breakfast,

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.024
- and, uh, hydrate.
- That way.

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:40.234
In that order.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:42.903
You made it.

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.989
I guess, uh, my speech
actually had some effect?

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:47.366
Well, no.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:50.035
Actually, I did some research
on you, and it

01:03:50.202 --> 01:03:51.954
turns out you're a bigger
loser than I am.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.499
Yeah, I mean, you've failed
so many times or been fired.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.085
It actually makes me feel
better about being

01:03:58.168 --> 01:03:59.503
the worst goalkeeper
in the world.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:00.587
Oh.

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:25.320
American Samoa,

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:28.865
in a few hours we will see you
on the field with Tonga!

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.618
- Tonga!
Tonga!

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:35.914
Tonga, in a few hours,
you meet American Samoa

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.458
on the field.

01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:40.168
Also.

01:04:47.259 --> 01:04:48.844
Tonga! Move it out!

01:04:53.599 --> 01:04:56.184
All right, guys.
They're scared.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.981
Welcome to
today's World Cup

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:04.651
qualifying match between Tonga
and American Samoa.

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:05.861
Thank you.

01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:07.404
Thank you.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:08.989
Here's your seat, darling.
Here's your seat.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.117
- Hi, fellas.
- Alligator! How are ya?

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.874
Don't know what
to say, really.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:23.211
A few minutes
to the biggest battle

01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:24.630
of our professional lives.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.757
All comes down to today.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:31.887
Now, either we heal as a team.

01:05:33.347 --> 01:05:36.683
Or we're going to crumble,
inch by inch,

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.227
play by play,
till we're finished.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:42.064
Hang on. That's the Any Given
Sunday speech.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:45.525
No, Daru.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:50.614
So, I'd like you to see
this space as a safe space

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.616
where you can share
your stories,

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.118
your thoughts, hopes
and dreams.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:58.163
So, please. Anyone.

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:06.171
Hey, what's up, everybody?
It's me, Smiley.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:07.506
Hey, Smiley.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.883
Um, it's funny you guys
call me Smiley.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.093
I don't really smile much

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.844
outside of this place.

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:15.514
As some of you may know,

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.265
I had a pretty rough year
this past year

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:20.644
after both my parents
got arrested for...

01:06:20.727 --> 01:06:21.728
Let's go, guys, time to play.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.606
Another time, Smiley.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.484
Okay, guys,
we've done the hard work.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.902
Let's do this!

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.446
Wait a minute,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:32.614
Where's Jaiyah?

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:34.783
- Jaiyah, where is she?

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:36.284
Where's Jaiyah?

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:45.419
Jaiyah! What's going on?

01:06:45.711 --> 01:06:47.087
Go away, coach.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.298
- What's wrong?
- I just...

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:54.219
You know what? Pregame nerves.
Totally normal.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.346
Pregame nerves.

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:59.266
Everybody gets them.
Hey, hey, hey,

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.309
come on, come on.
Oi, hey, hey.

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:03.895
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:06.940
What is it? Hey, talk to me.

01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:11.611
I went off my hormones.

01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:15.282
I went off my hormones
so I could perform better.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.451
For you and for the boys.

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.578
And now I don't feel
like myself.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:22.372
I feel ugly.
And everyone knows it. And...

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:24.166
I feel crazy.

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:27.252
And I can't do this, coach,
I can't.

01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:29.629
- Hey, hey?

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.007
Look at me. Keep your head up,
keep your head up.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:34.301
Come on, keep your head up.
Be proud.

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.720
You inspire those players
in there.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:38.764
I can't inspire them.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.724
I need your help.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:44.644
They're not going
to follow me.

01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:47.647
But they will follow you.

01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:51.693
Will you do me a favor,

01:07:51.777 --> 01:07:53.445
and lead them out
onto the pitch?

01:08:04.206 --> 01:08:05.207
Yeah?

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.542
Come on. Up you get.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.797
Let's get you ready.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:16.593
Okay, right.
Let's fix your hair, here.

01:08:17.469 --> 01:08:18.845
Yeah. That's nice.

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:22.557
- Yeah, that looks terrible.
- It's kind of nice.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:25.477
It's the way I used
to do my daughter's hair.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.020
- She liked it.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.647
Well, she was
probably lying to you.

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:30.649
Very possible.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:33.819
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

01:08:33.985 --> 01:08:34.986
Okay.

01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:38.114
I'll see you out there.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.289
American Samoa!

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:34.522
Hey, boss.
I got these made up for us.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:35.690
For you and me.

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:39.319
- The two Miyagis.
- Yeah. Two Miyagis.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.447
Shh, shh, shh!

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.573
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:45.200
It's starting,
it's starting. Shh.

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:49.162
I'm embarrassed already.

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:01.800
Let's go, boys.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:10.183
Excellent.
Yes, Jaiyah.

01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:11.935
Open it, give him some space.

01:11:14.396 --> 01:11:15.397
Go, Jonah!
- Hit it!

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.857
- Go, Jonah!
Kick it!

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.278
This close. It was this close.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.322
Here we go again.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.825
Watch, watch, watch.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:27.993
I got him! I got him!

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.244
Go, Daru!

01:11:29.411 --> 01:11:30.829
Daru,
stay on your feet!

01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:32.038
Stay on your feet!

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:35.709
- Hold that back line.
Yeah.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.003
Squeeze him, Jaiyah!
Don't let him roll you.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.089
Come out, Nicky!

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.549
Come on, Nicky, you can do it!

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:44.884
Good, good.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:45.969
That's it.

01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:48.555
Jaiyah! Don't let him
roll you like that.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:50.807
It's okay.

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:54.853
Guys, guys! Go, go, go!

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:56.646
Pass it off! Pass it off!

01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.858
Find the player.
Come on, Samson.

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:01.359
Samson!
Hunt him down.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.486
First try, Jonah. First try!

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.825
Not your day, mate.

01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:10.452
Shut up!

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:11.953
Don't get fired, mate.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.997
Get back, back, back! Back!

01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:16.416
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.251
Beat him to it.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.298
Daru, what was that?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:12:23.715 --> 01:12:25.008
- Come on!
Bring it in!

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:26.342
Bring it in. Come on.

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:30.096
Rambo, switch with Vegas.
Daru, be careful.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.015
- Nicole, I need you to...
- Nicole?

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.809
Jaiyah, I need you to control
that back line.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.603
You have to communicate!

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.980
Now, I made you captain.
Now own it. Let's go!

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:40.190
- Okay, coach.
- Come on, team!

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.274
Let's go, team!

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:42.442
Let's go, team!

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.949
- Keep going.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:52.494
Go. Pass, pass. Pass.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:58.083
Pass it. Support him.
What the...

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.419
Coach.
- Okay.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.301
Shit!

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:15.266
Jaiyah, hold that back line!
Where are you going?

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.529
Ah! Shit.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:35.245
Let's go, Rambo.
Come on.

01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:56.057
Goal!
No!

01:13:56.224 --> 01:13:57.809
Oh, shit! Fuck!

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.484
And that's halftime.

01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:09.404
Tonga takes a one nil lead
into the half.

01:14:33.887 --> 01:14:34.929
Shut up!

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.764
Sit down!

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.226
What the hell is
going on out there?

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.020
What about all the training?

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.438
This is bullshit.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.192
I would've killed
to play international soccer.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:50.570
But you losers don't seem
to give two shits.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.197
You're losers!

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:54.449
I'm sorry, coach.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:56.492
We're just not feeling it.

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:58.912
"Sorry, coach.
I'm just not feeling it."

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.789
What does that mean,
"not feeling it"? Nothing!

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.875
It does mean something,
Thomas.

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:06.252
Feeling is very important
to us.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.213
It's not that we've forgotten
what you have taught us.

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:11.174
It's... it's just that we've
taken too much to heart.

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:13.927
It's too tense.
We keep thinking we might win.

01:15:14.886 --> 01:15:16.179
We've never fought
like that before.

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:18.181
Well, don't worry. Because
that's not gonna happen

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:19.807
the way you're playing.
Trust me.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.276
Yeah. Ah, Samson says

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.362
the guys are really
stressed out.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:33.821
And stress is a silent killer.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:34.989
It's like when the Predator...

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:37.283
Really?
Yeah.

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.411
Great. Perfect. I give up.
Sick of this shit.

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:42.622
Good luck.

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.881
Mr. Rongen? Mr. Rongen.

01:15:52.674 --> 01:15:55.551
What? What do you want
from me, Tavita?

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.845
Look, I like you.
But I'm done.

01:15:57.929 --> 01:15:59.097
I got to get off this island.

01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:00.306
And you're not going
to change my mind

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.058
with any stories
of marinated fish.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.936
I'm not here to talk
about marinated fish.

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.646
But I want you to be happy.

01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:08.982
I'm not happy.
I'm not a happy person.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.608
And I hate to break it to you,

01:16:10.692 --> 01:16:12.443
but you're not going
to get your "one goal."

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:14.237
That's all right.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.281
I'm kind of used to that
by now, Mr. Rongen.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:18.324
It's not my fault, man.
I tried.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.701
- I know, I know.
- They don't listen to me.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:20.827
- I know.
- It's over!

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.579
- They're shutting you down.
- Oh. That I did not know.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.834
That will be why
Mr. Alex is here.

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:32.255
Oh, well.

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:33.965
On the bright side,

01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:36.592
I got to go
on a tropical island getaway.

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.220
Take in the sights
with my friend, Thomas.

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:41.389
What is it with you?

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.975
Why are you always
so positive?

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:45.059
It's sickening.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.812
You should coach them.
They believe in you.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:48.938
They believe in you.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.857
But you have to show them
who you are.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.026
They don't know you.
You don't talk to them.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:54.944
Ever since you got
to our island,

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.029
you've been somewhere else.

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:57.989
Even now,
you're somewhere else.

01:16:58.156 --> 01:16:59.157
Maybe it's in the past,

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.200
because you thought
you were happier then.

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:03.619
But I think you could
be happy here, now.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.164
But you actually have
to be here, now.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.126
I can't win.

01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:12.170
Then lose.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.465
But don't lose alone.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:17.592
Lose with us.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:20.553
And there's always
the second half.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:22.847
That's another chance.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:26.476
Second halves everywhere.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.494
Right. Get rid of it.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:46.412
This is all nonsense.

01:18:02.804 --> 01:18:04.764
Mmm. Okay.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:09.143
Shouldn't have, uh,
called you losers.

01:18:09.227 --> 01:18:11.437
Um, it's not true. You're not.

01:18:13.648 --> 01:18:14.649
I'm the loser.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:20.780
So,
two years ago,

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.824
I lost my daughter
in a car accident.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:24.534
Her name was Nicole.

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:28.538
And that's her hat.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.252
She was the greatest,
you know.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:37.171
She was, um, bright and funny,
and, uh,

01:18:37.672 --> 01:18:40.091
she loved soccer.
She loved it.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.971
We used to sit up
and talk about the game.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.055
Most nights.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:48.641
And then, uh,

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.768
one day, she was
on her way to practice

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:53.187
and she lost control
and crashed.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:55.022
That was it.

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:57.024
She was gone.

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.194
I lost my baby.

01:19:00.987 --> 01:19:02.697
Sorry. Okay.

01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:07.076
I guess, I got pretty angry
at the world

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.829
but mainly, I was angry
at myself. Maybe...

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.206
if I took her to practice,
she'd still be here.

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:16.002
Maybe if I was there
for her a bit more.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:17.587
A lot of maybes.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:21.674
Why'd I take this job?

01:19:21.883 --> 01:19:23.634
For the challenge? No.

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:24.886
I couldn't give two shits

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:25.970
about turning
this team around.

01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:28.723
I was, uh, forced to take it.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:31.267
It was the only job
I could get.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:33.561
And I didn't want it, guys.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.731
You know, I thought
I was better than you.

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:42.904
And fact of the matter is,
you don't need me at all.

01:19:43.488 --> 01:19:44.780
You're already perfect.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:49.619
So basically, my advice
to you would be,

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:50.703
"Don't listen to me."

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:54.415
Go out there
and do what you do.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:56.250
Or don't do it.

01:19:56.751 --> 01:19:58.669
Whatever. You know?

01:19:59.337 --> 01:20:00.463
You've reminded me

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:03.341
that I've always loved playing
more than winning.

01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:05.968
So, enjoy this match.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:08.387
I mean, life's short.
Football's a game.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:11.224
I just want you all
to be happy.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:16.229
But we want to win, coach.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:19.815
Then be happy.

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:41.522
Coach,
nice pep talk.

01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:15.389
Hey, Chief,
got any spare chicken, there?

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:22.480
No pressure.

01:22:22.897 --> 01:22:24.023
Enjoy yourselves.

01:22:24.315 --> 01:22:25.441
It's just a game.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.861
Life is good.

01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:30.696
Yes, Jaiyah. Yeah.

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:32.990
Oh, good kicking!

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:34.241
Push up, push up, push up.

01:22:35.368 --> 01:22:36.369
Look for it.

01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:32.216
Goal!
- Yeah!

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.677
- Yeah!

01:23:37.388 --> 01:23:39.765
We scored a goal!
We scored a goal!

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:41.726
We actually scored a goal!

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.151
That's my boy! That's my boy!

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:53.446
This is the first
goal ever for American Samoa.

01:23:53.738 --> 01:23:55.072
Let's go, Samoa!

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:58.367
My baby!
Rambo did it, you guys.

01:23:58.534 --> 01:23:59.785
What a match!

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.831
Wow!

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:16.177
Whoa, no, no, no. Whoa.
Somebody!

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:19.013
Darling! Darling!

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:20.097
Oh, no!

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:22.349
- Help!
- Somebody.

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.477
I need medical assistance
over in section...

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.399
Hey, Ma. Dad. Dad. Wake up.

01:24:31.192 --> 01:24:33.110
Dad, it's me. Dad?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.404
No, no, no. Okay, okay.
Hey, hey.

01:24:35.488 --> 01:24:36.530
Calm down. Calm down.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.449
- What happened?

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:40.743
They said I suffered
a massive stroke.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.036
Heat stroke.

01:24:42.495 --> 01:24:44.246
Yeah, a massive heat stroke.

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:45.414
It was awful, son.

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.957
Scary for everyone involved.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.919
But in time,
maybe even an hour,

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:52.505
I think I'll be up
on my feet again.

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:53.672
Okay, you're going to be okay.

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:55.132
How much did we lose by?
10-one?

01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:56.342
- What was the final score?
- Calm down, Dad. Okay?

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.552
- Breathe in.  Out.

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.554
- I'm ready, I'm ready, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Calm down.

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.014
- Tell me what happened.
- Calm down. You calm?

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:03.182
Okay. Yeah. Go.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.266
Now I'm going to tell you
what happened.

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.768
- Tell me what happened.
- All right.

01:25:07.645 --> 01:25:09.146
Possession kept going
back and forth.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:11.440
And things were tense.

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:13.609
Because we knew the whole
country was watching.

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:17.196
And that people would talk
about this day

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:18.697
for years to come.

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:21.742
And then Tonga broke
with the ball.

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:23.619
- I got him!
- It was a one-on-one

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.204
between me and Alishe and I
thought I could take the ball.

01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:26.872
But if I dived in and missed,

01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:28.207
there was going
to be a certain goal.

01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.709
But it was different.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:31.877
I felt different.

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:33.921
I stood up

01:25:35.381 --> 01:25:36.382
and I tackled him.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.468
Suddenly, we're on the attack.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.513
I played the ball up to Vegas.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:44.098
He saw the keeper
out of position and

01:25:44.265 --> 01:25:46.016
he shot with
his almighty power.

01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:50.604
But the keeper

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.606
saved and scrambled it
behind for a corner.

01:25:52.857 --> 01:25:55.067
Yes! This is it, this is it.

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.235
Jaiyah!

01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:57.570
Get up.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.990
In the box there was
a lot of tussling,

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:02.408
and things were
getting serious.

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:04.493
Deph took the corner.

01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.038
It was a right-footed
in-swinger.

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:10.708
It looked like Tonga
would clear.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.334
But then...

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.295
Jaiyah.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:21.969
Goal.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:23.345
Yeah!

01:26:27.016 --> 01:26:28.976
That's what
I'm talking about, boy.

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.519
Goal!

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.605
And another
historic goal!

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:38.027
Unbelievable!
American Samoa...

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.194
Yes!

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:40.362
...the
last-ranked team in the world,

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:41.864
might actually win this thing!

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:43.824
- We scored?
- Yeah.

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.618
- A goal? An actual goal?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:46.785
Another one?

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.329
- Okay.
- Did you hear that? Two!

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.664
Everything was going great.
With only 30 seconds left

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:52.166
on the clock.
We were winning.

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:53.667
But then the referee decided
to add

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:54.877
five minutes to the game.

01:26:55.044 --> 01:26:56.211
- What a disgrace.
- Yeah.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.379
Then what happened?

01:26:57.463 --> 01:26:58.672
The match
was almost over.

01:26:58.756 --> 01:27:00.174
We were holding up
under the pressure.

01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:06.931
Got it!

01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:08.641
Stop, thief!

01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:10.893
You can only get away
with one of those a game.

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:13.687
The ball was passed wide
and the Tonga winger

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.439
sent over a great cross.

01:27:17.024 --> 01:27:18.525
Nicky was catching these
all day,

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.152
but under the pressure...

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:23.238
...he fumbled it.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.407
It hit his hand and it was
rolling towards the goal.

01:27:26.951 --> 01:27:27.993
- Oh, shit.
Then,

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.161
out of nowhere

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:30.746
came Jaiyah.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:32.539
She slid in at the last minute
and hooked

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:34.583
the ball off the line,
saving a certain goal.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.251
Yes, Jaiyah! Yes!

01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:37.962
But then,

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:39.338
the ball fell to Alishe

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.173
and he wasn't going to miss.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.841
I didn't have any option.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.802
As he drew back to shoot,
I dived in.

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.847
Clear penalty.
It was my fault.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:51.433
- Hit him, darling.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:54.812
- You idiot!
- Then what happened?

01:27:54.979 --> 01:27:57.106
Nicky Salapu had to
face the penalty by himself.

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:59.149
- Oh, Jesus, it gets worse.
Oh, God.

01:28:06.532 --> 01:28:08.409
"I had been catching these
all day.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.452
"It was my time."

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:12.955
Everything was
on the line.

01:28:13.122 --> 01:28:14.540
Oh, the pressure!

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:15.708
- Yeah. He was under pressure.
- Oh, pressure.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:17.001
- Absolutely. Pressure.
- Oh! Pressure cooker.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:18.168
Come on, Nicky.
Go, Nicky.

01:28:18.252 --> 01:28:19.336
Let's go, Nicky!
Let's go!

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:23.549
- Let's go, Nicky.
Don't tell me

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:25.634
Nicky Salapu had a meltdown
in goal?

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:27.636
The horror of those
31 goals against

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:28.804
Australia 10 years ago

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.180
came back and haunted him.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.146
I suppose he lost
his composure

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:38.689
and just stepped aside
and let the ball go in.

01:28:38.856 --> 01:28:40.149
Damn everyone watching!

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:41.400
Is that what happened?

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:43.444
He probably was
freaking out a bit.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.070
"But I wasn't freaking out."

01:28:45.404 --> 01:28:46.989
Nicky wasn't freaking out

01:28:47.531 --> 01:28:49.491
because he knew
he had the history

01:28:49.575 --> 01:28:51.910
of a thousand chiefs
holding him up.

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.246
But he just had to
let go of everything.

01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:55.497
"The past."

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:58.625
The present.

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:00.794
"The future.

01:29:01.754 --> 01:29:02.921
"But I had to let it go.

01:29:05.049 --> 01:29:06.175
"All of it."

01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.678
He just had to become Nicky.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.973
I'm Nicky Salapu. Say it.

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:15.225
I'm Nicky Salapu.

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:41.043
The whistle blew.

01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:44.129
For a second, we didn't know
what was going on.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.507
We never felt
like this before.

01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:48.425
Until we'd realized...

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.136
With a final
score of two-to-one,

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.679
American Samoa...

01:29:52.846 --> 01:29:56.058
We win! We won!
We won! We won!

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:59.645
Yeah!

01:30:07.653 --> 01:30:09.571
American Samoa
wins its

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.698
first match ever!

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:26.338
We did this!

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:31.135
All right!

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.110
- We won?
- We won?

01:30:48.277 --> 01:30:50.237
- We won. You won a game, Dad.
- What?

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:52.030
- Yes, Jesus, we won!
- Oh, we won!

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:53.365
- Yes!

01:30:53.532 --> 01:30:54.700
- I always knew it.

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:56.577
Oh, son,
I knew you could do it.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.745
- Oh, my heart, my heart!
- Okay.

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:00.122
One goal! One goal!

01:31:11.884 --> 01:31:13.927
Last saved message.

01:31:14.928 --> 01:31:16.513
Okay, seriously,

01:31:17.264 --> 01:31:19.683
get Mom to show you
how to check your messages.

01:31:20.434 --> 01:31:22.477
Although, I guess
if you're hearing this,

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:24.188
you've figured it out.

01:31:25.606 --> 01:31:27.191
Anyway, to answer
your question,

01:31:27.357 --> 01:31:29.234
school is good.
It's great, actually.

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:31.570
I genuinely
like all my classes.

01:31:31.737 --> 01:31:33.822
Intro to Psych is really cool,
and so is Anthro.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:35.616
That professor is
just awesome.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:38.368
And everyone's happy
to be here.

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.120
I've met so many new people.

01:31:40.287 --> 01:31:41.914
And there's just
so much to talk about.

01:31:42.456 --> 01:31:45.709
I mean, it's like
anything's possible, you know?

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.712
I don't know.
I guess I'm just saying

01:31:48.795 --> 01:31:50.505
there's more to life
than soccer.

01:31:51.882 --> 01:31:53.759
Okay. Love you.

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:52.401
Dear Lord.
What more can I say?

01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:53.694
Nothing, really.

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:56.280
I had a dream
and it came true.

01:32:56.613 --> 01:32:57.823
We scored a goal.

01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:59.157
And then we scored
another goal.

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:00.409
And then we won a game!

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.578
And then, we lost
the next game.

01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:05.622
And we didn't qualify
for the World Cup.

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:07.791
But you know what, Lord?
Despite that loss,

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:09.543
I'm happy.

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:12.254
So, thank you
for sending us Mr. Rongen.

01:33:12.421 --> 01:33:14.298
We've become
quite attached to him.

01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:17.467
It's like finding a little
lost white kid at the mall

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:19.469
and telling him
which way to go.

01:33:20.554 --> 01:33:22.556
Thank you, Lord. Amen.

01:33:22.723 --> 01:33:23.807
Amen.

01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:25.183
Dear Lord.

01:33:26.059 --> 01:33:29.646
I'm praying as a weird way
of letting the team know that

01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:31.481
I've been offered a job

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:33.317
with MLS side, LA Galaxy

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.027
starting immediately.

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:40.490
But as of today, I've decided
not to take the job. Amen.

01:33:40.824 --> 01:33:42.326
Amen.
Wow, Lord, that is

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:45.871
a huge gesture and
a real credit to us as a team.

01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:48.874
Uh, well, Lord, the thing is

01:33:49.458 --> 01:33:50.542
I'm still leaving.

01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:53.920
But not for football, Lord.

01:33:54.755 --> 01:33:56.631
I want some time for me.

01:33:56.923 --> 01:33:58.717
Uh, you know,
so I can remind myself

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:01.178
that there's other
more important things

01:34:01.345 --> 01:34:03.388
to life than this game. Amen.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:04.890
Amen.
Dear Lord.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.100
Way to get our hopes up, jeez!

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:08.977
It's a real rollercoaster
ride, this one.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.521
Oh, well, in that case,

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:16.485
please tell Mr. Rongen that
we love him very much.

01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:21.323
And that he will always have
a home here in American Samoa.

01:34:24.618 --> 01:34:25.619
Amen.

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:05.492
 Do you want
to get your asses kicked

01:35:05.575 --> 01:35:08.078
by Tonga?
Go! Pressure! Fighter!

01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:10.664
Ay-ay-ay, Daru.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:12.999
Yes, yes.

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:24.886
Good job.

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.732
Come on, Jaiyah, go!
Push, push, push, push!

01:35:39.192 --> 01:35:40.652
Just want to say,
I love you guys.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.948
No matter how different I am.
And how different we all are.

01:43:16.316 --> 01:43:18.151
And so ends
our tale of woe.

01:43:18.902 --> 01:43:20.862
I guess it just goes to show,

01:43:20.945 --> 01:43:22.530
no matter what happens to you,

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:24.908
when the going gets rough,
when the chips are down,

01:43:25.074 --> 01:43:26.618
when you feel like
you can't carry on,

01:43:26.784 --> 01:43:28.369
when you feel
like there's no hope

01:43:29.245 --> 01:43:30.705
or you just can't do it,

01:43:32.665 --> 01:43:34.375
anything can happen

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:36.628
and a whole lot of miracles

01:43:37.462 --> 01:43:40.465
when you just have
a little bit of faith.

01:43:47.472 --> 01:43:48.723
Ah, shit!
